      <h1>Help</h1>
      <h2>Do you sell name-brand or generic medicines?</h2>
      <p>We offer both generic and branded types of medication. You can order either product; however, the generic
        version is cheaper due to the lack of advertisement. The generic drug performs the same as brand-name pills
        but at a lower cost.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What medications do you sell?</h2>
      <p>A complete list of medications is available on our website under “products.” Because some medications are
        considered controlled substances, the law requires you to undergo a physical exam by your doctor to obtain
        them. In these cases, we cannot sell the medication online. Such medicines include Valium, Lorazepam,
        Ativan, Diazepam, Clonazepam, Klonopin, and others.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What does Generic Mean?</h2>
      <p>Generic means using a different name for the same ingredients. The contents of the pills are absolutely the
        same in our generic version as in the branded analog. Typically, generic drugs are different because they
        are not marketed.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Why is your product so inexpensive?</h2>
      <p>There are several reasons are products are less expensive than our competitors. Our products come into the
        country unregistered; therefore, there are no taxes. We do not spend anything on marketing, the manufacturer
        is in an offshore zone, and the production costs are way lower. (No child labor is used.)</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Why does the name printed on the pill differ from the branded one?</h2>
      <p>The name found printed on each pill is the active ingredient used. The elements used to make generic
        medications are the exact same as name-branded medications, with the only difference being the name. <br>The
        laws restrict manufacturers from using brand names on their generic drugs since it would be Copywrite
        infringement. However, it is 100% legal to use the same ingredients when manufacturing their
        pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Why does the shape of the generic pill look different from the branded version?</h2>
      <p>Similar to the copywriting issues with the drug names, the shape of the pill cannot look the same from one
        brand to the next. For this reason, generic pills will look different, yet the ingredients remain the same.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What is the difference between Soft Tabs and Regular tabs?</h2>
      <p>The difference lies in the speed of action and the zone of absorption. Soft tabs act faster and dissolve
        under the tongue. This allows you to take alcohol or eat fatty foods before sexual intercourse. Regular tabs
        don't work as quickly as soft ones, and drinking is severely unrecommended.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>How are the products packaged?</h2>
      <p>Pills come in blistered packages containing ten pills in each. Orders containing 60 pills (6-10 packs) will
        ship in one package. Larger orders will be split into two or more packages and delivered in separate
        envelopes.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Will other products be provided in the future?</h2>
      <p>If you don’t see the medication you are looking for on our website, please contact us as soon as possible,
        and we will try our best to obtain it and add it to our product list.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Are Your Products FDA approved?</h2>
      <p>All our products are shipped from and manufactured in India; they are all approved for export by the INDIAN
        FDA.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What can I expect after submitting my order?</h2>
      <p>After you submit your order, it is sent to our order system, where a licensed physician will review your
        information and approve or deny the request. <br>As long as the order is approved, a script provided by the
        same physician will be sent to our ordering system, and the pharmacy will fill and ship the medication
        promptly.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>What methods of payment are accepted?</h2>
      <p>To ensure your order is processed in a very short time frame, we only accept credit cards and e-checks at
        this time. Once your payment is approved, your products are packaged and shipped immediately.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Which credit cards do you accept?</h2>
      <p>At this time, our company accepts AmEx, Vis, and E-Checks.</p>
