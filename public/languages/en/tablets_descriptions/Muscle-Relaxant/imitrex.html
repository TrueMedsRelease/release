    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Imitrex is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Imitrex is a headache medicine that narrows blood vessels around the brain. Imitrex also reduces substances in the body that can trigger headache pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and other migraine symptoms.

    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Use Imitrex exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label. Overuse of migraine headache medicine can actually make your headaches worse.
    <br>Use Imitrex as soon as you notice headache symptoms, or after an attack has already begun.
    <br>Your doctor may want to give your first dose of this medicine in a hospital or clinic setting to see if you have any serious side effects.
    <br>Take one Imitrex tablet whole with a full glass of water. Do not split the tablet.
    <br>After taking a tablet: If your headache does not completely go away, or goes away and comes back, take a second tablet two (2) hours after the first. Do not take more than 200 mg of sumatriptan oral tablets in 24 hours. If your symptoms have not improved, contact your doctor before taking any more tablets.
    <br>Since Imitrex is used as needed, it does not have a daily dosing schedule. Call your doctor promptly if your symptoms do not improve after using this medicine.
    <br>After taking a Imitrex tablet, you must wait two (2) hours before taking a second tablet. Do not take more than 200 mg of sumatriptan tablets in 24 hours.
    <br>After using Imitrex nasal spray, you must wait two (2) hours before using a second spray. Do not use more than 40 mg of nasal spray in 24 hours.
    <br>Contact your doctor if you have more than four headaches in one month (30 days).
    <br>In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of IMITREX Tablets were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg.
    <br>The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events.
    <br>If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg.
