If they are often higher or lower than they should be and you take Metformin exactly as prescribed, tell your doctor.<br> This medicine does not usually lower your blood sugar levels. Low blood sugar may be more likely to occur if you skip a meal, exercise heavily, or drink alcohol. It may also be more likely if you take Metformin along with certain medicines for diabetes (e.g., sulfonylureas, insulin). It is a good idea to carry a reliable source of glucose (e.g., tablets or gel) to treat low blood sugar. If this is not available, you should eat or drink a quick source of sugar like table sugar, honey, candy, orange juice, or non-diet soda. This will raise your blood sugar level quickly. Tell your doctor right away if this happens.

If any of these occur, check your blood sugar closely and tell your doctor right away.<br> Metformin may commonly cause stomach upset, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea at the beginning of treatment.

Low blood sugar levels may also be more difficult to recognize in the elderly.<br> Metformin should not be used in children younger than 10 years old; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.<br> Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor.
