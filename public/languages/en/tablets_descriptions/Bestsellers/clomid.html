<p><strong>Common use</strong><br><br> Clomid is an non-steroid anti-estrogen. Mechanism of its action consists in a specific binding with receptor for estrogen in ovary and hypophis. In patients with low estrogen levels in organism it causes estrogen effect and in ones with high estrogen levels it causes anti-estrogen effect. Its small doses increase secretion of gonadotropins (prolactin, Follicle stimulating hormone, FSH and interstitial cell-stimulating hormone), stimulates ovulation; in large doses slows secretion of gonadotropins. Clomid stimulates ovulation and prepares the body for pregnancy. This medication may be used for male patients with infertility caused by low production of sperm. <br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Clomid is administered to stimulate ovulation.
