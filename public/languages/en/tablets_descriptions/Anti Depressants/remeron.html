            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your progress. Continue to take your medicine even if
you do not feel better right away. You may have to take this medicine for several weeks before you feel better.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Patients and their families should watch out for depression or thoughts of suicide that get worse. Also watch out for sudden
or severe changes in feelings such as feeling anxious, agitated, panicky, irritable, hostile, aggressive, impulsive, severely
restless, overly excited and hyperactive, or not being able to sleep. If this happens, especially at the beginning of treatment
or after a change in dose, call your health care professional.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this
drug affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or
fainting spells. Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Do not treat yourself for coughs, colds, or allergies without asking your doctor or health care professional for advice. Some
ingredients can increase possible side effects.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy, and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor
if the problem does not go away or is severe.
