<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br> Tricor contains active substance fenofibrate. In the tissues it turns into the active metabolite: fenofibric acid. In combination with a diet it is used to treat people with very high levels of triglycerides in the blood or lipid disorders. The drug increases activity of lipoprotein lipase, catabolism of triglycerides in the very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), accelerates transfer of cholesterol from atherogenic the very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to the antiatherogenic high-density lipoproteins (HDL), decreases synthesis of VLDL. <br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction</strong><br><br> Take orally 160 mg of Tricor three times a day as initial dose to treat high cholesterol levels or a combination of high cholesterol and high triglycerides. For treatment of high triglyceride levels<br> the starting dose of Tricor is 54-160 mg a day. It may be gradually increased every 4-8 weeks up to maximal dose of Tricor 160 mg a day if triglycerides do not improve.<br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> Activity of transaminases should be monitored on a regular basis in the patients taking Tricor. If blood tests for ALT increase 2 and more times and accompaigned by myalgia and muscle weakness, treatment with Tricor should be discontinued. Tricor treatment combined with a hypolipidemic diet should be exercised only under control of a doctor and and continue for a long period of time. Tricor has the potential to cause gallstones.<br><br><strong> Contraindications<br></strong><br> Hypersensitivity to the components of Tricor.<br><br> <strong>Possible side effect<br></strong><br> Cholelithiasis, increased levels of transaminases and creatine kinase, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, myositis, rhabdomyolysis (is the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle due to injury to muscle tissue), acute renal failure, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, back pain, fatigue, impotence, skin rash. If you experience these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.<br><br> <strong>Drug interaction<br></strong><br> Inform your doctor about all prescribed and over-the-counter medication you are currently taking and especially about "blood thinners" (warfarin), cyclosporine (cholesterl-lowering drug), MAO inhibitors (selegiline, furazolidone, tranylcypromine, phenelzine, moclobemide), diabetic medicine (glipizide, insulin), estrogens/birth control pills, "statins" (lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin) and high-dose niacin (1 gram or more per day). Combined with Tricor the two last types of drugs may cause muscle injury (myopathy).<br><br> <strong>Missed dose<br></strong><br> If you forgot to take your dose in time, please do it as soon as you remember.
