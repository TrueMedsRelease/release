    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Atorlip-20 is used to treat high cholesterol. Atorlip-20 is also used to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other heart complications in people with coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Atorlip-20 is a cholesterol-lowering medication that blocks the production of cholesterol (a type of fat) in the body. Atorlip-20 reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol in the blood. Lowering your cholesterol can help prevent heart disease and hardening of the arteries, conditions that can lead to heart attack, stroke, and vascular disease.
