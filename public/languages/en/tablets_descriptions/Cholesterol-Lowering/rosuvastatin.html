    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Rosuvastatin is used for lowering high cholesterol and triglycerides in certain patients. It also increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL, "good") cholesterol levels. It is also used to slow atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) in patients with high blood cholesterol levels. It is used along with an appropriate diet. Rosuvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, also known as a "statin." It works by reducing the production of certain fatty substances in the body, including cholesterol.
