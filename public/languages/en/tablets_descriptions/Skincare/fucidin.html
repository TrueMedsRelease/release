    <strong>How to use</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Use Fucidin as directed by your doctor.&nbsp;
    <br> Apply a small amount to the lesion three or four times daily until favourable results are achieved. If your doctor has directed you to cover the lesion with a gauze dressing, less frequent applications (one or two daily) may be used. Avoid the eyes if the medication is being applied to the face. 
    <br> Ask your health care provider any questions you may have about how to use Fucidin.

    <strong>Drug Class and Mechanism</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Fucidin is an antibiotic medicine. It works by entering bacterial cells and interfering with the production of proteins that the bacteria need to divide and multiply. It does not directly kill the bacteria, but leaves them unable to increase in numbers. The existing bacteria eventually die or are destroyed by the immune system. Fusidic acid is included in this preparation to treat the bacteria that sometimes infect inflammatory skin diseases.&nbsp;

    <strong>Missed Dose</strong>
    <br>
    <br>If you miss a dose of Fucidin, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Storage</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Store Fucidin at room temperature, between 68 and 77 degrees F (20 and 25 degrees C). Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Keep Fucidin out of the reach of children and away from pets.

    <strong>Warnings/Precautions</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Organism overgrowth: Use of antibiotics applied to the skin occasionally allows overgrowth of organisms that are not killed by the antibiotic. If the infection does not improve within a few days or seems to get worse at any time, contact your doctor.&nbsp;
    <br> Severe skin infections or infections that do not appear to heal with the use of a topical (skin-applied) medication should be treated with a systemic (oral or injectable) antibiotic in addition to or instead of a topical medication. 
    <br>
    <br>Pregnancy: The safety of this medication for treating infections during pregnancy has not been established. If its use by a pregnant woman is considered necessary, the potential benefits should be weighed against the possible risks. There is evidence to suggest that the medication can cross the placenta. 
    <br>
    <br>Breast-feeding: There is evidence to suggest that this medication passes into breast milk. The safety of this medication for treating infections in nursing women has not been established.
