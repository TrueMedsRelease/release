    <strong>Product Description</strong>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>As a synthetic analog of prostaglandin with ocular hypotensive activity, Bimat decreases intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Bimat may increase the percent and duration of hairs in the growth phase, resulting in eyelash growth.
    <br>
    <br> 
    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Remove make-up and contact lenses prior to application; ensure face is clean. Apply with the sterile applicator provided only; do not use other brushes or applicators. Use a tissue or cloth to blot any excess solution on the outside of the upper eyelid margin; do not apply to lower eyelash line. Do not reuse applicators; use new applicator for second eye. Applying more than once nightly will not increase eyelash growth; eyelash growth is expected to return to baseline when therapy is discontinued. May reinsert contacts 15 minutes after application.
    <br>
    <br>May be used with other eye drops to lower intraocular pressure. If using more than one ophthalmic product, wait at least 5 minutes in between application of each medication. Remove contact lenses prior to administration and wait 15 minutes before reinserting.
    <br>
    <br>Missed Dosage:
    <br> 
    <br>In case you miss a dose, use it as soon as you notice. If it is close to the time of your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your dosing schedule. Do not use extra dose to make up for a missed dose. If you are regularly missing doses, consider setting an alarm or asking a family member to remind you. Please consult your doctor to discuss changes in your dosing schedule or a new schedule to make up for missed doses, if you have missed too many doses recently.

If you suspect that you or anyone else who may have overdosed of Bimat, please go to the emergency department of the closest hospital or nursing home.
