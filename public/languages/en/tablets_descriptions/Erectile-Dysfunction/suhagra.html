    <br>  
    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>The main component of Suhagra is Sildenafil.
    <br>Sildenafil affects the response to sexual stimulation. It acts by enhancing smooth muscle relaxation using nitric oxide, a chemical that is normally released in response to sexual stimulation. This smooth muscle relaxation allows increased blood flow into certain areas of the penis, which leads to an erection.
    <br>Sildenafil is applied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (impotence) in men and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
    <br>Sildenafil may also be used for other purposes not listed above.
    <br>
    <br> 
    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>It is taken by mouth with a glass of water approximately 0,5-1 hour before sexual activity. Suhagra should not be taken more than once a day.
    <br>A high fat meal may delay the time of the effect of this drug.
    <br>Try not to eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are being treated with Sildenafil.
