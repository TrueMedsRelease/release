    <br> 
    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Take Ciplox exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.
    <br>Take Ciplox with a full glass of water (8 ounces). Drink several extra glasses of fluid each day while you are taking this medicine. Ciplox may be taken with or without food, but take it at the same time each day. Shake the oral suspension (liquid) for at least 15 seconds just before you measure a dose. To be sure you get the correct dose, measure the liquid with a marked measuring spoon or medicine cup, not with a regular table spoon. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.
    <br>When taking the Ciplox oral liquid, swallow it without chewing the medicine beads you may notice in the liquid.
    <br>Do not crush, chew, or break an extended-release tablet. Swallow it whole. Breaking the pill may cause too much of the drug to be released at one time. Do not take Ciplox with dairy products such as milk or yogurt, or with calcium-fortified juice. You may eat or drink these products as part of a regular meal, but do not use them alone when taking Ciplox. They could make the medication less effective.
    <br>Take Ciplox for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Skipping doses may also increase your risk of further infection that is resistant to antibiotics. Ciplox will not treat a viral infection such as the common cold or flu.
    <br>Store Ciplox at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not allow the liquid medicine to freeze.
    <br>If you missed a dose - take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.
    <br>Take exactly as prescribed by your Health Provider.
