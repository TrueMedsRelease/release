    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Myambutol may cause dizziness. Do not drive, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how you react to Myambutol. Using Myambutol alone, with certain other medicines, or with alcohol may lessen your ability to drive or perform other potentially dangerous tasks.
    <br>It is important to use Myambutol for the full course of treatment. Failure to do so may decrease the effectiveness of Myambutol and increase the risk that the bacteria will no longer be sensitive to Myambutol and will not be able to be treated by this or certain other antibiotics in the future.
    <br>Myambutol is effective only against certain types of bacteria. It is not effective for treating viral infections (eg, the common cold).
    <br>Long-term or repeated use of Myambutol may cause a second infection. Your doctor may want to change your medicine to treat the second infection. Contact your doctor if signs of a second infection occur.
    <br>Lab tests, including liver and kidney function tests, complete blood cell counts, and vision tests, may be performed to monitor your progress or to check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Myambutol should not be used in children younger 13 years. Safety and effectiveness in this age group have not been confirmed.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of using Myambutol during pregnancy. Myambutol is excreted in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you are using Myambutol, check with your doctor or pharmacist to discuss the risks to your baby.
