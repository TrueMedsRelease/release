    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Suprax may cause dizziness. This effect may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Suprax with caution. Do not drive or perform other possibly unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Do not change dose forms (eg, tablets, suspension) of Suprax without talking with your doctor.
    <br>Mild diarrhea is common with antibiotic use. However, a more serious form of diarrhea (pseudomembranous colitis) may rarely occur. This may develop while you use the antibiotic or within several months after you stop using it. Contact your doctor right away if stomach pain or cramps, severe diarrhea, or bloody stools occur. Do not treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor.
    <br>Suprax only works against bacteria; it does not treat viral infections (eg, the common cold).
    <br>Be sure to use Suprax for the full course of treatment. If you do not, the medicine may not clear up your infection completely. The bacteria could also become less sensitive to this or other medicines. This could make the infection harder to treat in the future.
    <br>Long-term or repeated use of Suprax may cause a second infection. Tell your doctor if signs of a second infection occur. Your medicine may need to be changed to treat this.
    <br>Suprax may reduce the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your blood. Avoid activities that may cause bruising or injury. Tell your doctor if you have unusual bruising or bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have dark, tarry, or bloody stools.
    <br>Do not receive a live typhoid vaccine while you are taking Suprax. It may not work as well. Talk with your doctor if you are scheduled to receive a live typhoid vaccine.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Suprax may cause the results of some tests for urine glucose or urine ketones to be wrong. Ask your doctor before you change your diet or the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Suprax may interfere with certain lab tests. Be sure your doctor and lab personnel know you are using Suprax.
    <br>Suprax should be used with extreme caution in children younger 6 months; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Suprax while you are pregnant. It is not known if Suprax is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you use Suprax, check with your doctor or pharmacist. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.
