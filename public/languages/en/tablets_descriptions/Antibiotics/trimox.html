    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Trimox may cause dizziness. This effect may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Trimox with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Trimox only works against bacteria; it does not treat viral infections (eg, the common cold).
    <br>Be sure to use Trimox for the full course of treatment. If you do not, the medicine may not clear up your infection completely. The bacteria could also become less sensitive to this or other medicines. This could make the infection harder to treat in the future.
    <br>Long-term or repeated use of Trimox may cause a second infection. Tell your doctor if signs of a second infection occur. Your medicine may need to be changed to treat this.
    <br>Mild diarrhea is common with antibiotic use. However, a more serious form of diarrhea (pseudomembranous colitis) may rarely occur. This may develop while you use the antibiotic or within several months after you stop using it. Contact your doctor right away if stomach pain or cramps, severe diarrhea, or bloody stools occur. Do not treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor.
    <br>Hormonal birth control (eg, birth control pills) may not work as well while you are using Trimox. To prevent pregnancy, use an extra form of birth control (eg, condoms).
    <br>Brown, yellow, or gray tooth discoloration has occurred rarely in some patients taking Trimox. It occurred most often in children. The discoloration was reduced or removed by brushing or dental cleaning in most cases. Contact your doctor if you experience this effect.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Trimox may cause the results of some tests for urine glucose to be wrong. Ask your doctor before you change your diet or the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Lab tests, including liver function, kidney function, and complete blood cell counts, may be performed if you use Trimox for a long period of time. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use Trimox with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially patients with kidney problems.
    <br>Use Trimox with extreme caution in children younger 10 years who have diarrhea or an infection of the stomach or bowel.
    <br>Caution is advised when using Trimox in children younger 3 months; they may be more sensitive to its effects.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Trimox while you are pregnant. Trimox is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you use Trimox, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.
