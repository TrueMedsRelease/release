<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br> Yasmin contains Drospirenone (a synthetic hormone progestin) and Ethinyl Estradiol and is used as a preventive drug to avoid pregnancy. It interferes with a woman's menstrual cycle and tricks the body as if ovulation has taken place even if it has not. So a ripened egg is not released by the ovaries. The drug changes condition of cervical mucus and uterine lining and hampers movement of sperm cells to the uterus and attachment of a fertilized egg to the uterus.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Start treatment on the very first day of your menstrual cycle and then take one pill daily. If you missed a daily dose, take two pills as a single dose. Risk of your pregnancy increases if you miss more than one dose. Do not take other contraceptive pill concomitantly with Yasmin to avoid serious hormonal imbalance. Each pill contains 3.0 mg of drospirenone and 0.030 mg of ethinyl estradiol, while 7 'inactive' pills do not contain the hormones.<br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> Additional birth control methods (condoms or a spermicide) may be required when you start to use Yasmin.<br> Intake of hormones may increase the risk of blood clotting, heart attack, stroke, especially in the patients over 35 y.o. or smokers.
