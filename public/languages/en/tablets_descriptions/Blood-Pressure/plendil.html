    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Plendil is used for treating high blood pressure, alone or with other medications. Plendil is a calcium channel blocker. It works by blocking the normal action of calcium on blood vessels and the heart. This allows the blood vessels to relax, the heart to beat with less force and pump out less blood, and the heart to beat more slowly and regularly.
