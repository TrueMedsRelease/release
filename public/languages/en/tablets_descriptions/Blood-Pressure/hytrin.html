    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Hytrin is used for treating high blood pressure and treating signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Hytrin is an alpha-blocker. It works by relaxing muscles in the blood vessels, resulting in lowering of blood pressure. In BPH, alpha-blockers work by relaxing muscles around the urethra (tube that drains urine from the bladder), which improves urinary symptoms.

    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Hytrin may cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, or lightheadedness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Hytrin with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Do not drink alcohol or use medicines that may cause drowsiness (eg, sleep aids, muscle relaxers) while you are using Hytrin; it may add to their effects. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about which medicines may cause drowsiness.
    <br>Hytrin may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure after the first dose. Take your first dose at bedtime. If you get up during the night, sit up slowly, then stand slowly. This will help to reduce your lightheadedness or dizziness. These effects are more likely to occur after the first few doses or if your dose has increased, but can occur at any time while you are taking the medicine. It can also occur if you stop taking the medicine and then restart treatment.
    <br>Hytrin may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of these effects.
    <br>Patients who take medicine for high blood pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new symptoms.
    <br>Do NOT take more than the recommended dose without checking with your doctor.
    <br>Hytrin may rarely cause a prolonged, painful erection. This could happen even when you are not having sex. If this is not treated right away, it could lead to permanent sexual problems such as impotence. Contact your doctor right away if this happens.
    <br>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take Hytrin before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery (including eye surgery).
    <br>Lab tests, including blood pressure, may be performed while you use Hytrin. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Hytrin should not be used in children; safety and effectiveness in children have not been confirmed.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Hytrin while you are pregnant. It is not known if Hytrin is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you use Hytrin, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.
