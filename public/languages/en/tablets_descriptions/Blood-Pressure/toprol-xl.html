    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Toprol XL, a type of medication known as a beta blocker, is used in the treatment of high blood pressure, angina pectoris (chest pain, usually caused by lack of oxygen to the heart due to clogged arteries), and heart attack. When prescribed for high blood pressure, it is effective when used alone or in combination with other high blood pressure medications. Beta blockers decrease the force and rate of heart contractions, thereby reducing the demand for oxygen and lowering blood pressure.

    <br>Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.
    <br>Take Toprol XL at the same time every day.
    <br>Toprol XL should be taken with food or just after a meal. A Toprol XL tablet can be divided in half if your doctor has told you to do so. The half tablet should be swallowed whole, without chewing or crushing. Chewing or crushing the pill could cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.

    <br>Your blood pressure will need to be checked often. Visit your doctor regularly.
