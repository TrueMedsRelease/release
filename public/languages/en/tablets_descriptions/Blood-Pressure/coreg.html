    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Coreg is used for treating high blood pressure or certain types of heart failure. It may also be used after a heart attack to improve survival in certain patients. It may be used along with other medicines. Coreg is an alpha- and beta-blocker. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, slowing down the heart, and decreasing the amount of blood it pumps out. This decreases blood pressure, helps the heart pump more efficiently, and reduces the workload on the heart.

    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Coreg may cause dizziness, fainting, or blurred vision. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Coreg with caution. Do not drive or perform other possibl unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Coreg may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. These effects may occur within the first hour after you take your dose. They may be more likely when you start taking Coreg or if your dose is increased. Alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of these effects. Tell your doctor if these effects occur.
    <br>Do not take more than the recommended dose without checking with your doctor.
    <br>Do not suddenly stop taking Coreg. Sharp chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and sometimes heart attack may occur if you suddenly stop Coreg. The risk may be greater if you have certain types of heart disease. Your doctor should slowly lower your dose over several weeks if you need to stop taking it. This should be done even if you only take Coreg for high blood pressure. Heart disease is common and you may not know you have it. Limit physical activity while you are lowering your dose. If new or worsened chest pain or other heart problems occur, contact your doctor right away. You may need to start taking Coreg again.
    <br>Patients who take medicine for high blood pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new symptoms.
    <br>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take Coreg before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery.
    <br>If you have a history of any severe allergic reaction, talk with your doctor. You may be at risk for an even more severe allergic reaction if you come into contact with the substance that caused your allergy. Some medicines used to treat severe allergies may also not work as well while you are using Coreg.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Coreg may affect your blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Coreg may hide signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid heartbeat. Be sure to watch for other signs of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar may make you anxious, sweaty, weak, dizzy, drowsy, or faint. It may also make your vision change; give you a headache, chills, or tremors; or make you more hungry. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Lab tests, including blood pressure and heart function, may be performed while you use Coreg. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use Coreg with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially dizziness.
    <br>Coreg should be used with extreme caution in children younger 18 years; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Coreg while you are pregnant. It is not known if Coreg is found in breast milk. Do not breast-feed while taking Coreg.
