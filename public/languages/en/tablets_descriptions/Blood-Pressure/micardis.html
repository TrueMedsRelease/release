<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br> Micardis is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in patients aged 55 years and older to help lower their risk of having certain cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart attack, or death. Also it is used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Micardis lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow. The reduced pressure in the arteries also makes it easier for the heart to pump blood.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Take Micardis tablets exactly as it is written in prescription of your doctor. Do not change your dose unless your doctor tells you to. Take Micardis one time each day at the same time by mouth with or without food.
