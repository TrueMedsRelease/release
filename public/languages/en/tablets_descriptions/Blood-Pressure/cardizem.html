    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Cardizem is used for treating supraventricular tachycardia, a rhythm disturbance of the heart. It is also used for controlling heart rate response to other rhythm disturbances, specifically, atrial fibrillation and flutter. Cardizem is a calcium channel blocker. It works by slowing the electrical conduction in the heart, slowing heart rate, and/or normalizing heart rhythm.

    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Use Cardizem as directed by your doctor.
    <br>Do not take the medication in larger amounts, or take it for longer than recommended by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label.
    <br>Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results from this medication.
    <br>Take Cardizem with a full glass of water. Swallow the pill whole. It is specially made to release medicine slowly in the body. Breaking or opening the pill would cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.
    <br>It is important to use Cardizem regularly to get the most benefit. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.
    <br>Do not stop taking this medication without first talking to your doctor. If you stop taking Cardizem suddenly, your condition may become worse.
    <br>If you are being treated for high blood pressure, keep using this medication even if you feel fine. 
    <br>If you miss a dose of Cardizem, use it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not use 2 doses at once.
    <br>Ask your health care provider any questions you may have about how to use Cardizem.
