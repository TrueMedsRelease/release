    <br> 
    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>InnoPran XL is used for treating high blood pressure. InnoPran XL is a beta-blocker. It works by slowing down the heart and decreasing the amount of blood it pumps out. This decreases blood pressure, helps the heart pump more efficiently, and reduces the workload on the heart.

    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>InnoPran XL may cause drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, or vision changes. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use InnoPran XL with caution. Do not drive or perform other possibly unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Check with your doctor before you drink alcohol while you are taking InnoPran XL; it may increase the risk of InnoPran XL's side effects.
    <br>Do NOT take more than the recommended dose without checking with your doctor.
    <br>Patients who take medicine for high blood pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new symptoms.
    <br>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take InnoPran XL before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery.
    <br>If you have a history of any severe allergic reaction, talk with your doctor. You may be at risk of an even more severe allergic reaction if you come into contact with the substance that caused your allergy. Some medicines used to treat severe allergies may also not work as well while you are using InnoPran XL.
    <br>InnoPran XL may lower your blood sugar levels. This is most likely to happen in infants and children, or in patients who have diabetes or kidney problems. It may also occur after prolonged physical activity or during fasting. Low blood sugar may make you anxious, sweaty, weak, dizzy, drowsy, or faint. It may also make your heart beat faster; make your vision change; give you a headache, chills, or tremors; or make you more hungry. If this is not available, you should eat or drink a quick source of sugar like table sugar, honey, candy, orange juice, or non-diet soda. This will raise your blood sugar level quickly. Tell your doctor right away if this happens.
    <br>Diabetes patients - InnoPran XL may hide signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid heartbeat. Be sure to watch for other signs of low blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>InnoPran XL may interfere with certain lab tests, including the glaucoma screening test and dobutamine stress echocardiography. Be sure your doctor and lab personnel know you are taking InnoPran XL.
    <br>Lab tests, including blood pressure and heart function tests, may be performed while you use InnoPran XL. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use InnoPran XL with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects.
    <br>InnoPran XL should be used with extreme caution in children; safety and effectiveness in children have not been confirmed. Children may be more sensitive to InnoPran XL's effects, especially low blood sugar levels or shortness of breath.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using InnoPran XL while you are pregnant. InnoPran XL is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you use InnoPran XL, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.
    <br>If you suddenly stop taking InnoPran XL, you may experience withdrawal symptoms, including worsening chest pain along with possible heart attack.
