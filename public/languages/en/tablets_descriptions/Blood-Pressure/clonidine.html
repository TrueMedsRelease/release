<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br> Clonidine may be used orally or as patches applied to your skin, it treats high blood pressure. It acts by changing the concentration of certain chemicals in blood and stimulating alpha2-adrenoceptors in the brain stem that reduces transmission of a signal from brain to other areas in the body. Its action results in a decrease in peripheral resistance, renal vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Usually Clonidine is taken twice daily, the dosage depends on individual blood pressure response of a patient. Do not use this drug if it was not prescribed to you by your physician. In case you use patches they should be applied to an area of hairless skin on the upper arm or torso, once every 7 days. When you change the patch for a new one, choose a different area of skin.<br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> Avoid drinking alcohol, be especially attentive if you need to drive or make any work which requires high concentration of attention.<br><br> <strong>Contraindications <br></strong><br> Hypersensitivity to Clonidine or any component of the formulation.
