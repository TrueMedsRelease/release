    <br>you are pregnant
    <br>you are taking dextran sulfate or a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, amiloride).
    <br>Contact your doctor or health care provider right away if any of these apply to you.
    <br>Some medical conditions may interact with Vasotec. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have any medical conditions, especially if any of the following apply to you:
    <br>if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding
    <br>if you are taking any prescription or nonprescription medicine, herbal preparation, or dietary supplement
    <br>if you have allergies to medicines, foods, or other substances
    <br>if you have or have ever had liver or kidney problems or kidney transplantation

    <br>if you have narrowing or hardening of the arteries of the brain or heart, chest pain, or discomfort known as angina.
    <br>Some medicines may interact with Vasotec. Tell your health care provider if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of the following:
    <br>Diuretics (eg, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide) because excessive decreases in blood pressure may occur, which may cause dizziness, especially upon standing, or fainting
    <br>Dextran sulfate because it may increase the risk of allergic reaction (eg, rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue) and lightheadedness upon standing
    <br>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, aspirin, indomethacin) because they may decrease Vasotec's effectiveness and the risk of kidney damage may be increased
    <br>Oral diabetes medicine (eg, glyburide) because side effects, including a low blood sugar level (eg, dizziness, headache, hunger, shakiness or weakness, sweating), may be increased by Vasotec
    <br>Lithium or thiopurines (eg, azathioprine) because the risk of serious side effects may be increased by Vasotec
    <br>Certain gold-containing medicines (eg, sodium aurothiomalate) because flushing, nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure may occur
    <br>Potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, amiloride) or potassium supplements may cause high blood potassium levels (eg, abnormal skin sensations of the arms and legs, confusion, heaviness of the limbs, listlessness, slow or irregular heartbeat, stopping of the heart) when used with Vasotec.
    <br>This may not be a complete list of all interactions that may occur. Ask your health care provider if Vasotec may interact with other medicines that you take. Check with your health care provider before you start, stop, or change the dose of any medicine.
