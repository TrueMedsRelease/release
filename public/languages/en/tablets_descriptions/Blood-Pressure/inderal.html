<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br> Inderal acts by blocking beta-adrenergic substances such as adrenaline (epinephrine), a key agent in the "sympathetic" portion of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system which is responsible for work of the heart. The medication is used to treat tremors, chest pain, hypertension, heart rhythm disorders, ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardiodystrophy and other conditions.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Take orally disregarding the time of your meal. Take Inderal with a full glass of water at the same time every day. Do not chew, crush, break, or open an Inderal capsule. Swallow the tab whole. <br> Do not stop taking the medication suddenly as it may cause problems to your heart.<br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> Do not use this drug if you suffer from asthma or certain heart conditions, especially second or third degree heart block, liver or kidney failure. Avoid drinking alcohol. Do not stop taking the medication even if you feel better as hypertension may have no symptoms.<br><br> <strong>Contraindications</strong> <br><br> Sinus bradycardia, incomplete or complete atrioventricular block (problems with conduction of excitation in the excitation-conduction system of the heart), severe right and left ventricular failure, bronchial asthma and a tendency to bronchospasm, pregnancy, disorders of peripheral arterial blood flow.
