            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your progress. Check your blood pressure  regularly. Ask
your doctor or health care professional what your blood pressure should be and when you should contact him or her.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Drowsiness and dizziness are more likely to occur after the first dose, after an increase in dose, or during hot weather or
exercise. These effects can decrease once your body adjusts to this medicine. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything
that needs mental alertness until you know how this drug affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are
an older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells. Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic
drinks.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Do not treat yourself for coughs, colds or allergies without asking your doctor or health care professional for advice. Some
ingredients can increase your blood pressure.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy, and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your doctor
if the problem does not go away or is severe.
