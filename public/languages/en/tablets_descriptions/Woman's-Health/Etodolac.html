    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. NSAIDs treat the symptoms of pain and inflammation. They do not treat the disease that causes those symptoms.
    <br>Etodolac is used to treat pain or inflammation caused by arthritis or osteoarthritis. It also reduces pain, swelling, and joint stiffness from arthritis.
