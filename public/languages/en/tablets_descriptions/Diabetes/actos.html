<p><strong>Product Description</strong><br><br> Common use<br><br> Actos is used to control high blood sugar in type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). This form of the illness is usually caused by inability of the body to respond correctly to insulin: either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. Insulin is the natural hormone that helps to transfer sugar out of the blood and into the cells, where it is metabolized to energy. Actos works by improving the response of the body to insulin, rather than increasing its insulin output. Actos also reduces the production of unneeded sugar in the liver.<br> It is possible to use Actos (and rosiglitazone maleate as well) alone or together with insulin injections or other oral diabetes medications such as glipizide, glyburide, metformin hydrochloride.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and directions</strong><br><br> Take this medication by mouth, with or without food, usually one time a day.
