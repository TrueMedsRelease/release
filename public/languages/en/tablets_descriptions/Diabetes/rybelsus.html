    <strong>Does it work the same as the injections( Ozempic and Wegovy)?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    In short, yes. Just like the weekly injection, it mimics a natural hormone already found in your body (GLP-1). It works in three key ways to reduce your appetite.
    <br>
    <br>
    1) It blocks a key hunger hormone telling your brain that you are hungry, whilst also helping to reduce leptin resistance (a hormone which can help off-set weight gain by increasing satiety aka fullness, and speed up your metabolism to help regulate the levels of fatty tissue in your body). This also helps stop the weight from coming straight back on when you stop the jab.
    <br>
    <br>
    2) It slows down the gastric emptying process, meaning that your body takes longer to process food and it is fuller for longer. This means your body does not need as much intake as normal as it works off the food it has.
    <br>
    <br>
    3) The medication helps to speed up your metabolism and increase fat burning by reducing glucogen & reducing insulin resistance. This promotes normal blood glucose levels, the liver metabolism of glucose and helps adipose tissue burn fat in a safe and controlled method without causing a sugar-crash. This avoids the urges for quick-fix sugary foods.

    <strong>How do I use it?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    This comes as a daily tablet. Whilst it is the same medication as the weekly jab, it needs to be taken daily as our body acts much faster at metabolising oral medication than injections.

    <strong>Any side effects?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Like any new medication introduced to your body, your body will have to adjust to it. Some people get mild side effects, such as headaches, nausea, dry mouth or tiredness. These side effects are generally mild and are transient - which means they will go after a few days once your body has adjusted.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some clients experience no side effects, whilst the majority of our own clients experience LESS side effects than the jabs.
