    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Paroxetine may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or blurred vision. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Paroxetine with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.

Contact the doctor right away if any signs of suicidal thoughts or actions occur.
    <br>If your doctor tells you to stop taking Paroxetine, you will need to wait for several weeks before beginning to take certain other medicines (eg, MAOIs, nefazodone). Ask your doctor when you should start to take your new medicines after you have stopped taking Paroxetine.

Contact your doctor at once if you have any of these symptoms.
