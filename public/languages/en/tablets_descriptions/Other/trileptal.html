    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Use Trileptal as directed by your doctor.
    <br>Take Trileptal by mouth with or without food.
    <br>It is important to take all doses on time to keep the level of medicine in your blood constant. Take doses at evenly spaced intervals. Do not skip doses.
    <br>Taking Trileptal at the same times each day will help you remember to take it.
    <br>Continue to take Trileptal even if you feel well. Do not miss any doses. Trileptal works best when there is a constant level of it in your body.
    <br>If Trileptal is stopped, it should be done gradually. The risk of seizures may be increased if Trileptal is suddenly stopped.
    <br>If you miss a dose of Trileptal, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.
    <br>Ask your health care provider any questions you may have about how to use Trileptal.
