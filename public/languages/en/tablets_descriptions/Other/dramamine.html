    <strong>Safety information</strong>

    <br><b>Do NOT use Dramamine if:</b>
    <br>you are allergic to any ingredient in Dramamine or other similar medicines
    <br>you are taking sodium oxybate (GHB)
    <br>you are currently taking or have taken a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (eg, phenelzine) in the past 14 days

    <br>Dramamine may cause drowsiness or dizziness. Do not drive, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how you react to Dramamine. Using Dramamine alone, with certain other medicines, or with alcohol may lessen your ability to drive or to perform other potentially dangerous tasks.
    <br>Avoid drinking alcohol or taking other medications that cause drowsiness (eg, sedatives, tranquilizers) while taking Dramamine. Dramamine will add to the effects of alcohol and other depressants. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about which medicines are depressants.
    <br>Dramamine may cause dizziness. Alcohol, hot weather, exercise, and fever can increase this effect. To prevent it, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Also, sit or lie down at the first sign of dizziness.
    <br>Do not exceed the recommended dose or use Dramamine more frequently or for longer than prescribed without first checking with your doctor.
    <br>Do not become overheated in hot weather or during exercise or other activities since heatstroke may occur.
    <br>Dramamine may cause increased sensitivity to the sun. Avoid exposure to the sun, sunlamps, or tanning booths until you know how you react to Dramamine. Use a sunscreen or protective clothing if you must be outside for a prolonged period.
    <br>Do not use Dramamine with any medicine that contains diphenhydramine. Before you begin taking any new prescription or nonprescription medicine, including one used on the skin, read the ingredients to see if it also contains diphenhydramine or another similar medicine (eg, antihistamine). If it does, or if you are uncertain if it does, contact your doctor or pharmacist.
    <br>Use Dramamine with caution in the ELDERLY because they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially dizziness, sedation, and lightheadedness upon standing.
    <br>Safe use and instructions for use in CHILDREN differs according to the brand used. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about the brand you are using.
    <br>Use of Dramamine is not recommended in CHILDREN younger than 2 years of age without first talking with the child's doctor. Safety and effectiveness in this age group have not been confirmed.
    <br>PREGNANCY and BREAST-FEEDING: If you become pregnant, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of using Dramamine during pregnancy. Dramamine is excreted in breast milk. Do not breast-feed while taking Dramamine.
