    <strong>Safety information</strong>
    <br>
    <br>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to allow for changes in your dose and to check for any unwanted effects.
    <br>Do not take selegiline if you have used meperidine (e.g., Demerol®) or an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, Marplan®, Nardil®, or Parnate®) within the past 14 days. If you do, you may develop agitation, confusion, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, sudden high body temperature, extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions.
    <br>Do not take cough medicines (e.g., dextromethorphan, Robitussin®, Pediacare®) or pain medicines (e.g., methadone, propoxyphene, tramadol, Darvon®, Dolophine®, Ultram®) while you are using this medicine. Using these medicines together can cause unwanted effects.
    <br>Selegiline may cause serious side effects when used together with some antidepressants. Tell your doctor if you have used amitriptyline, doxepin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, Elavil®, Luvox®, Pamelor®, Paxil®, Prozac®, or Zoloft® within the past 14 days.
    <br>When selegiline is taken at doses of 10 mg or less per day for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, there are no restrictions on food or beverages you eat or drink. However, the chance exists that dangerous reactions, such as sudden high blood pressure, may occur if doses higher than those used for Parkinson's disease are taken with certain foods, beverages, or other medicines. These foods, beverages, and medicines include:
    <br>Foods that have a high tyramine content (most common in foods that are aged or fermented to increase their flavor), such as cheeses; fava or broad bean pods; yeast or meat extracts; smoked or pickled meat, poultry, or fish; fermented sausage (bologna, pepperoni, salami, summer sausage) or other fermented meat; sauerkraut; or any overripe fruit. If a list of these foods and beverages is not given to you, ask your doctor to provide one.
    <br>Alcoholic beverages or alcohol-free or reduced-alcohol beer and wine.
    <br>Large amounts of caffeine-containing food or beverages such as coffee, tea, cola, or chocolate.
    <br>Any other medicine unless approved or prescribed by your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine, such as that for colds (including nose drops or sprays), cough, asthma, hay fever, and appetite control; “keep awake” products; or products that make you sleepy.
    <br>Also, for at least 2 weeks after you stop taking this medicine, these foods, beverages, and other medicines may continue to react with selegiline if it was taken in doses higher than those usually used for Parkinson's disease.
    <br>Check with your doctor or hospital emergency room immediately if severe headache, stiff neck, chest pains, fast heartbeat, or nausea and vomiting occur while you are taking this medicine. These may be symptoms of a serious side effect that should have a doctor's attention.
    <br>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.
    <br>Selegiline may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.
    <br>It is important that your doctor check your skin for melanoma (tumor) regularly if you have Parkinson's disease.
    <br>Do not stop taking this medicine without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to reduce gradually the amount you are taking before stopping completely.
    <br>Hallucinations may occur in some patients. This is more common with elderly patients. If you have hallucinations, check with your doctor.
    <br>Some people who have used this medicine had unusual changes in their behavior. Talk with your doctor if you start having problems with gambling or increased sex drive while using this medicine.
