    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Hydroxyurea is used to treat skin cancer (melanoma), a cancer of the white blood cells called chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), and metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread) of the ovaries. This medicine may also be given together with radiation treatment for head and neck cancer (primary squamous cell cancer).
    <br>Hydroxyurea is also used in adult patients with sickle cell anemia to prevent painful episodes and reduce the need for blood transfusions. It works by making the red blood cells more flexible.

    <strong>Safety information</strong>
    <br>
    <br>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.
    <br>Make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant before you use this medicine. Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.
    <br>While you are being treated with hydroxyurea, and after you stop using it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Hydroxyurea may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not get live vaccines (eg, nasal flu vaccine, measles, mumps, or rubella) since there is a chance they could pass the infection on to you. Also, avoid persons who have had a live vaccine. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.
    <br>Hydroxyurea can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:
    <br>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
    <br>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.
    <br>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.
    <br>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.
    <br>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.
    <br>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.
    <br>Using this medicine for a long time may increase your risk of developing cancer of the blood (leukemia). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.
    <br>This medicine may cause temporary loss of hair in some people. After treatment has ended, normal hair growth should return, although the new hair may be a slightly different color or texture.
    <br>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
