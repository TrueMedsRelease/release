    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Strattera may cause dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, or fainting. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Strattera with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Strattera may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of these effects.
    <br>Do not take more than the recommended dose or take for longer than prescribed without checking with your doctor.
    <br>Children and teenagers who take Strattera may be at increased risk for suicidal thoughts or actions. Adults may also be affected. The risk may be greater in patients who have had suicidal thoughts or actions in the past. The risk may also be greater in patients who have had bipolar (manic-depressive) illness, or if their family members have had it. Watch patients who take Strattera closely especially during the first few months of taking Strattera and at times of dose changes. Contact the doctor at once if new, worsened, or sudden symptoms such as depressed mood; anxious, restless, or irritable behavior; panic attacks; or any unusual change in mood or behavior occur. Contact the doctor right away if any signs of suicidal thoughts or actions occur.
    <br>Do not try to open the capsules or take them apart. If a capsule breaks, do not touch it. Wash your hands and any surfaces that touched a broken capsule. Do not get Strattera in your eye; it may irritate your eye if you do. If you get Strattera in your eyes or nose, rinse at once with cool water.
    <br>Strattera may rarely cause a prolonged, painful erection. This could happen even when you are not having sex. If this is not treated right away, it could lead to permanent sexual problems such as impotence. Contact your doctor right away if this happens.
    <br>Lab tests, including heart rate, blood pressure, and liver function, may be performed while you take Strattera. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use Strattera with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially dizziness.
    <br>Strattera may affect growth rate in children and teenagers in some cases. They may need regular growth checks while they take Strattera.
    <br>Strattera should be used with extreme caution in children younger 6 years; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
