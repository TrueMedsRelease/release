    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Topamax may cause drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, or trouble concentrating. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Topamax with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Do not drink alcohol or use medicines that may cause drowsiness (eg, sleep aids, muscle relaxers) while you are using Topamax; it may add to their effects. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about which medicines may cause drowsiness.
    <br>Topamax may reduce sweating, which could raise body temperature, especially in children. This risk is greater in hot weather and/or during vigorous exercise. Drink plenty of fluids. Dress lightly while in hot climates or when exercising. Check carefully for signs of decreased sweating. If this occurs, promptly seek cooler or air-conditioned shelter and/or stop exercising. Seek medical attention right away if you have unexplained fever, or if you have mental or mood changes, headache, or dizziness.
    <br>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take Topamax before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery.
    <br>Hormonal birth control (eg, birth control pills) may not work as well while you are using Topamax. To prevent pregnancy, use an extra form of birth control (eg, condoms).
    <br>Lab tests, including serum bicarbonate levels, may be performed while you use Topamax. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use Topamax with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects.
    <br>Caution is advised when using Topamax in children; they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially decreased sweating and decreased bicarbonate levels.
    <br>Topamax may affect growth rate in children and teenagers in some cases. They may need regular growth checks while they take Topamax.
    <br>Topamax should be used with extreme caution in children for migraines and in children  younger than 2 years old for seizures; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
