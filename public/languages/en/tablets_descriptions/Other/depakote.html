    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>

    <br>Use Depakote as directed by your doctor.
    <br>Take Depakote by mouth with or without food. If stomach upset occurs, take with food to reduce stomach irritation.

    <br>Drink plenty of water while you are taking Depakote. Your dose may need to be changed if you do not get enough fluids each day.
    <br>Do not stop taking Depakote suddenly, especially if you are taking Depakote to prevent seizures. Suddenly stopping Depakote may cause severe seizures to occur. If you need to stop Depakote, your doctor will gradually lower your dose.
    <br>Taking Depakote at the same time each day will help you remember to take it.
    <br>Continue to take Depakote even if you feel well. Do not miss any dose. Depakote works best when there is a constant level of it in your body.
    <br>If you miss a dose of Depakote, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.
