    <br>Some MEDICINES MAY INTERACT with Epivir-HBV. Tell your health care provider if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of the following:
    <br>Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole because it may increase the risk of Epivir-HBV's side effects
    <br>Zalcitabine because it may decrease Epivir-HBV's effectiveness
    <br>This may not be a complete list of all interactions that may occur. Ask your health care provider if Epivir-HBV may interact with other medicines that you take. Check with your health care provider before you start, stop, or change the dose of any medicine.
    <br>Contact your doctor or health care provider right away if any of these apply to you.Epivir-HBV may cause drowsiness or dizziness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Epivir-HBV with caution. Do not drive or perform other possibly unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Your doctor will offer you counseling and testing for HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS) before treatment with Epivir-HBV and periodically during treatment. You should not take Epivir-HBV if you have HIV infection. If you have both hepatitis B virus and HIV, make sure that your doctor knows you have both infections. If you are prescribed lamivudine, you should only use the medicine that is for HIV treatment ( Epivir). The lower dose of lamivudine in Epivir-HBV could make the HIV infection harder to treat.
    <br>Epivir-HBV is not a cure for hepatitis B virus infection. It is unknown if Epivir-HBV reduces the risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis that may be caused by hepatitis B virus. Some patients developed hepatitis B virus that is resistant to Epivir-HBV. These patients had less benefit from Epivir-HBV and some experienced worsening of hepatitis after the resistant virus appeared.
    <br>Your doctor will perform lab tests for several months after you stop taking Epivir-HBV. Some patients have had worsening hepatitis B virus after stopping use of Epivir-HBV. Tell your doctor about any new or unusual symptoms that you notice after stopping treatment.
    <br>Epivir-HBV has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing hepatitis B to other people through sexual contact or blood contamination. Use barrier forms of contraception (eg, condoms) if you are infected with hepatitis B virus.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Epivir-HBV contains sucrose and may affect your blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Lab tests, including liver and kidney function tests, may be performed while you use Epivir-HBV. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Caution is advised when using Epivir-HBV in CHILDREN with a history of swelling of the pancreas. Epivir-HBV should not be used in CHILDREN younger than 2 years old; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
