    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Adults:
    <br>The dosage regime shows important interindividual variability, requiring an individualised dose finding approach. A reasonable protocol would be to introduce piracetam at a dosage of 7.2 g/day, increasing by 4.8 g/day every 3 to 4 days up to a maximum of 20g/day, given in either 2 or 3 divided doses while keeping other antimyoclonic drugs unchanged at their optimal dosage. If possible, depending on clinical benefit, an attempt should be made to subsequently reduce the dosage of other antimyoclonic drugs.
    <br>Take the medicine as prescribed by your doctor.
