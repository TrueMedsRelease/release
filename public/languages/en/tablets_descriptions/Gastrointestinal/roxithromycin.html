    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic. Roxithromycin is very similar in composition, chemical structure (semi-synthetic) and mechanism of action to erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Antibiotics such as Roxithromycin can often be prescribed for several different infections, including some STDs, upper and lower respiratory tract infections and asthma, gum infections like gingivitis, and bacterial infections associated with stomach and intestinal ulcers. Roxithromycin is absorbed well into the gastro-intestinal tract, with few side effects, and actively responds to the presence of cryptosporidium, pneumocystis carinii (PCP), toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium Avium (MAC).

    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Use Roxithromycin as directed by your doctor.
    <br>Take Roxithromycin by mouth with or without food. If stomach upset occurs, take with food to reduce stomach irritation.
    <br>To clear up your infection completely, take Roxithromycin for the full course of treatment. Keep taking it even if you feel better in a few days.
    <br>If you miss a dose of Roxithromycin, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.
