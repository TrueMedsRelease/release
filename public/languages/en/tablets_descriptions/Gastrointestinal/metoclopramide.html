    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Metoclopramide is used for short term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in certain patients who do not respond to other therapy. It is used to treat symptoms of a certain digestive problem in diabetic patients (diabetic gastroparesis). Metoclopramide is a gastrointestinal stimulant and antinauseant. It works by increasing the movement of the stomach and intestines to help move food and acid out of the stomach more quickly. It also works in certain areas in the brain to decrease nausea.

    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Metoclopramide may cause drowsiness or dizziness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Metoclopramide with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Do not drink alcohol or use medicines that may cause drowsiness (eg, sleep aids, muscle relaxers) while you are using Metoclopramide without first checking with your doctor; it may add to their effects. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about which medicines may cause drowsiness.
    <br>Do NOT take more than the recommended dose or use Metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks without checking with your doctor.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Metoclopramide may affect your blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take Metoclopramide before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery.
    <br>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a possibly fatal syndrome that can be caused by Metoclopramide. Symptoms may include fever; stiff muscles; confusion; abnormal thinking; fast or irregular heartbeat; and sweating. Contact your doctor at once if you have any of these symptoms.
    <br>Some patients who take Metoclopramide may develop muscle movements that they cannot control. This is more likely to happen in elderly patients, especially women. The chance that this will happen or that it will become permanent is greater in those who take Metoclopramide in higher doses or for a long time. Muscle problems may also occur after short-term treatment with low doses. Tell your doctor at once if you have muscle problems with your arms; legs; or your tongue, face, mouth, or jaw (eg, tongue sticking out, puffing of cheeks, mouth puckering, chewing movements) while taking Metoclopramide.
    <br>Patients who take Metoclopramide may be at increased risk for new or worsening mental or mood changes (eg, depression) or suicidal thoughts or actions. Watch patients who take Metoclopramide closely. Contact the doctor at once if new, worsened, or sudden symptoms such as depressed mood or any unusual change in mood or behavior occur. Contact the doctor right away if any signs of suicidal thoughts or actions occur.
    <br>Metoclopramide may increase the amount of a certain hormone (prolactin) in your blood. Symptoms may include enlarged breasts, missed menstrual period, decreased sexual ability, or nipple discharge. Contact your doctor right away if you experience any of these symptoms.
    <br>Lab tests, including liver and kidney function tests, may be performed while you use Metoclopramide. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use Metoclopramide with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially drowsiness, confusion, and uncontrolled muscle movements, including tardive dyskinesia.
    <br>Metoclopramide should be used with extreme caution in children; safety and effectiveness in children have not been confirmed. The risk of developing uncontrolled muscle movements may be greater in children.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Metoclopramide while you are pregnant. Metoclopramide is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you use Metoclopramide, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.
