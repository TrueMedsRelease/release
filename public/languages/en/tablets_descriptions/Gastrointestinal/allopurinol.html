<p><strong>Product Description</strong><br><br> Common use<br> Allopurinol is an arthrifuge which inhibits xanthine oxidase and prevents formation of uric acid, from xanthine and hypoxanthine. Reduces the concentration of uric acid and its salts in body fluids, promotes the dissolution of existing urate deposits and prevents their formation in tissues and kidneys. The medication is used to treat diseases accompanied by hyperuricemia: gout (primary and secondary), nephrolithiasis (forming of kidney stones from urates); hyperuricemia (abnormally high level of uric acid in blood, both primary and secondary), which results in diseases involving enhanced dissolution of nucleoproteins and elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, including at various forms of leukemias, and also for treatment of some other conditions.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction</strong><br><br> The dose of 100-800 mg a day may be prescribed depending on the condition. Initial dose of 100 mg can be increased gradually. Patients with acute gout and tophi (uric acid crystals in the tissues mostly around joints) should be treated with 300-400 mg of Allopuionol daily. Doses over 300 mg should be divided in two or more intakes. Take medication with food to avoid irritation of the stomach. Do not take large doses of vitamin C. Drink plenty of water to avoid formation of kidney stones. Limit consummation of alcoholic beverages and purine-rich foods such as sweetbreads, sardines, anchovies, kidneys, liver, and lentils.<br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> Allopurinol should be taken over a period of several months so your symptoms start to reduce.

The attacks will become shorter and less acute as the therapy continues.
