    <br>Acivir may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or changes in vision. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Acivir with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Acivir may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of these effects.

    <br>Acivir does not eliminate the virus and is not a cure. It does not prevent transmission of the virus to others.
    <br>Acivir is not a cure for herpes simplex infections. Avoid sexual intercourse when visible lesions are present to prevent infecting your partner.
    <br>Use Acivir with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially confusion, drowsiness, or hallucinations.
