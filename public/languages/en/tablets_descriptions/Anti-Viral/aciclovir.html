    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Aciclovir is an antiviral drug, it is a synthetic ingredient with a similar molecular structure to purine nucleoside. Aciclovir is used to treat viral infections such as cold sores, to stop the growth of Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus (caused by chickenpox and shingles), Epstein Barr Virus (caused by glandular fever), and to a lesser extent Cytomegalovirus (CMV). It is also useful in preventing genital herpes and in preventing viral infections occurring in those with a lowered immune system. This medication may also help reduce the time when pain remains after the sores heal. In addition, in people with a weakened immune system, Aciclovir can decrease the risk of the virus spreading to other parts of the body and causing serious infections.
