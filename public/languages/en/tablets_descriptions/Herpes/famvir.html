            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Famvir is an antiviral drug. It slows the growth and spread of the herpes virus so that the body can fight off the
infection. Famvir will not cure herpes, but it can lessen the symptoms of the infections.</br>

Famvir is used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses. Illnesses caused by herpes viruses include genital
herpes, cold sores, shingles, and chicken pox.
