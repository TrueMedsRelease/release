[faq]
# “text”
title = "FAQ"
faq_title = "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS"
q_1 = "Do you sell name-brand or generic medicines?"
a_1 = "We offer both generic and branded types of medication. You can order either product; however, the generic version is cheaper due to the lack of advertisement. The generic drug performs the same as brand-name pills but at a lower cost. "
q_2 = "What medications do you sell?"
a_2 = "A complete list of medications is available on our website under “products.” Because some medications are considered controlled substances, the law requires you to undergo a physical exam by your doctor to obtain them. In these cases, we cannot sell the medication online. Such medicines include Valium, Lorazepam, Ativan, Diazepam, Clonazepam, Klonopin, and others."
q_3 = "What does Generic Mean?"
a_3 = "Generic means using a different name for the same ingredients. The contents of the pills are absolutely the same in our generic version as in the branded analog. Typically, generic drugs are different because they are not marketed."
q_4 = "Why is your product so inexpensive?"
a_4 = "There are several reasons are products are less expensive than our competitors. Our products come into the country unregistered; therefore, there are no taxes. We do not spend anything on marketing, the manufacturer is in an offshore zone, and the production costs are way lower. (No child labor is used.)"
q_5 = "Why does the name printed on the pill differ from the branded one?"
a_5_1 = "The name found printed on each pill is the active ingredient used. The elements used to make generic medications are the exact same as name-branded medications, with the only difference being the name. "
a_5_2 = "The laws restrict manufacturers from using brand names on their generic drugs since it would be Copywrite infringement. However, it is 100% legal to use the same ingredients when manufacturing their pharmaceuticals. "
q_6 = "Why does the shape of the generic pill look different from the branded version?"
a_6 = "Similar to the copywriting issues with the drug names, the shape of the pill cannot look the same from one brand to the next. For this reason, generic pills will look different, yet the ingredients remain the same."
q_7 = "What is the difference between Soft Tabs and Regular tabs?"
a_7 = "The difference lies in the speed of action and the zone of absorption. Soft tabs act faster and dissolve under the tongue.  This allows you to take alcohol or eat fatty foods before sexual intercourse. Regular tabs don’t work as quickly as soft ones, and drinking is severely unrecommended."
q_8 = "How are the products packaged?"
a_8 = "Pills come in blistered packages containing ten pills in each. Orders containing 60 pills (6-10 packs) will ship in one package. Larger orders will be split into two or more packages and delivered in separate envelopes."
q_9 = "Will other products be provided in the future?"
a_9 = "If you don’t see the medication you are looking for on our website, please contact us as soon as possible, and we will try our best to obtain it and add it to our product list. "
q_10 = "Are Your Products FDA approved?"
a_10 = "All our products are shipped from and manufactured in India; they are all approved for export by the INDIAN FDA."
q_11 = "What can I expect after submitting my order?"
a_11_1 = "After you submit your order, it is sent to our order system, where a licensed physician will review your information and approve or deny the request. "
a_11_2 = "As long as the order is approved, a script provided by the same physician will be sent to our ordering system, and the pharmacy will fill and ship the medication promptly."
q_12 = "What methods of payment are accepted?"
a_12 = "To ensure your order is processed in a very short time frame, we only accept credit cards, crypto carrencies and sepa at this time. Once your payment is approved, your products are packaged and shipped immediately."
q_13 = "Which credit cards do you accept?"
a_13 = "At this time, our company accepts Visa, Mastercard, Amex, JCB, Dinners Club, Discover, Maestro."
q_14 = "When do you charge my credit card?"
a_14 = "Once your order is processed and excepted by the company billing department, your credit card will be charged."
q_15 = "What is your privacy policy?"
a_15_1 = "Our company is dedicated to protecting your personal information and keeping your private details secure. For complete transparency of our privacy policy, please refer to the privacy policy section in the terms and conditions listed on our website (on the order page.)"
a_15_2 = "Please note that our company uses quality security encryption technology, ensuring that your credit card and other information is submitted with the highest level of protection possible. Our online systems go through security checks frequently to maintain an adequately protected ordering system."
q_16 = "What is the cancelation policy for your company?"
a_16 = "You have the ability to cancel any order before it is shipped. Unfortunately, if your order has already shipped out, you cannot cancel the order or request an immediate refund. For more information on our cancellation policy, please refer to our order page's terms & conditions section."
q_17 = "What is SSL Encryption, and why is it required?"
a_17_1 = "SSL Encryption (otherwise known as HTTPS) is a way to keep private information transmitted over the internet safely and securely."
a_17_2 = "This encryption uses a Public Key Infrastructure (or PKI) to confirm the site’s legitimacy. This public/private key can encrypt ids, messages, and data to keep them secure once transmitted online."
a_17_3 = "To verify that our transmissions are encrypted, your browser should display a small padlock or key icon. You should also notice that the URL will begin with HTTPS instead of HTTP. SSL encryptions (HTTPS) provided by a digital certification authority help to secure our website with private and confidential information."
q_18 = "Are there age restrictions for purchases on your website?"
a_18 = "Customers 18 years and over are welcome to purchase any product from our website. Unfortunately, we do not service anyone under 18."
q_19 = "How are your orders shipped?"
a_19 = "We currently offer our customers two types of shipping methods. Courier service (trackable) and International registered airmail."
q_20 = "What counties do you ship your products to?"
a_20 = "Our company ships products worldwide. "
q_21 = "What if my order is delayed at customs?"
a_21 = "If you experience any issues obtaining your order, please contact our customer service center as soon as possible, and we will work hard to clear up any problems immediately."
q_22 = "What if my package is delivered damaged or does arrive at all?"
a_22 = "If you have any issues with your order, please contact customer service and we will re-send the product or refund your money. For more information, please see our policy section on our website."
q_23 = "When can I expect my package to arrive?"
a_23 = "Customers can choose from two types of delivery. Airmail or US Postal Service for US customers can take 2-3 weeks but may be delivered sooner. EMS courier delivery takes between 5-7 business days. (Excluding holidays)"
q_24 = "Why haven’t I received my confirmation email?"
a_24 = "If you have yet to receive a confirmation email, you may have entered an incorrect e-mail address when filling out your order. The email may also be missing because it was blocked and sent to your spam folder. Lastly, check to make sure your inbox is full. "
q_25 = "Why was my payment declined?"
a_25 = "If your payment was declined, you should check to ensure you provided the correct payment information. If the payment information is accurate, check to see if your credit card company approves online transactions and if there are enough funds to cover your order. "
q_26 = "Can I change my shipping option?"
a_26 = "All orders are sent out within 24 hours of the transaction approval. You can change the shipping at any point during this time by contacting our customer support department. Once the order is shipped, there is no way to change the shipping option."
q_27 = "Do I have to be home to sign for the package?"
a_27 = "Someone must be home at the delivery time to sign for your package. If no one is available to sign, the postal service will leave you a letter requesting you pick up the parcel from your local courier."
q_28 = "Can I track my order?"
a_28_1 = "If you want to check on the status of your order, you can log onto our support site to obtain the information there. Tracking information is also provided for all orders shipped via courier. "
a_28_2 = "You may check the order status if you log into our support site. A few days after the shipment is sent, we will provide you with a tracking number and a link to the website, allowing you to check the status of your order online.  "
q_29 = "My order was never delivered; what do I do now?"

Please contact our shipping department for further action if your package isn’t at the post office. Remember, a package shipped by airmail should arrive in no more than three weeks and no more than ten days if sent by courier. "
