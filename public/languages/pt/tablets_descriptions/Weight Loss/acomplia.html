            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#How does Acomplia work?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
            #LIST_ELEMENT_OPEN_TAG#Acomplia acts by selectively blocking CB1 receptors found in the brain and in peripheral organs important in
             glucose and lipid (or fat) metabolism, including adipose tissue, the liver, gastrointestinal tract and muscle1.#LIST_ELEMENT_CLOSE_TAG#
             #LIST_ELEMENT_OPEN_TAG#Acomplia switches off the same brain circuits that make people hungry when they smoke cannabis.#LIST_ELEMENT_CLOSE_TAG#
             #LIST_ELEMENT_OPEN_TAG#CB1 receptor blockade with Acomplia acts to decrease the overactivity of the endocannabinoid system (EC system)2,3.
             The EC system is a recently characterised physiological system that includes receptors such as the CB1 receptor and
             it has been shown to play an important role in regulating body weight and in controlling energy balance, as well as
             glucose and lipid (or fat) metabolism.#LIST_ELEMENT_CLOSE_TAG#
