<p><strong>Drug Name</strong><br /><br />Alli (Orlistat)&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Drug Uses</strong><br /><br />Alli is the only FDA approved, over-the-counter weight loss product, represented as an innovative weight loss program. With Alli, you can lose about 50% more weight than with just dieting alone.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>How to use</strong><br /><br />For overweight adults 18 and older, take 1 capsule with each meal containing fat. Use with a reduced calorie, low-fat diet and exercise program until you reach your weight loss goal. Most weight loss occurs in the first 6 months.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Drug Class and Mechanism</strong><br /><br />Alli blocks about 25% of the fat you eat. Typically, enzymes in your intestines break down fat from food so your body can absorb the fat. But, the active ingredient in Alli attaches to some of these enzymes and prevents them from digesting about a quarter of the fat you eat. Because undigested fat can't be absorbed, it passes out of your body instead of turning into calories.&nbsp;<br />Missed Dose<br /><br />If you miss a dose of Alli, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.&nbsp;<br />Storage<br /><br />Store Alli at room temperature, between 68 and 77 degrees F (20 and 25 degrees C). Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Keep Alli out of the reach of children and away from pets.</p><p><strong>Warnings/Precautions</strong><br /><br /><strong>Do not use Alli if:&nbsp;</strong><br /> you are allergic to any ingredient in Alli; <br /> you have gallbladder problems; <br /> you have cholestasis (a problem of bile flow from the liver to the intestines). <br /> Contact your doctor or health care provider right away if any of these apply to you. <br /><br /> <strong>Important : </strong><br /> Do not take more than the recommended dose without checking with your doctor. Exceeding the recommended dose will not make you lose more weight and may increase side effects. <br /> Tell your doctor or dentist that you take Alli before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery. <br /> Follow the diet program given to you by your health care provider. Your daily intake of fat should be divided evenly over 3 meals. <br /> Eating a meal high in fat while taking Alli increases the risk of side effects involving the stomach and intestines. <br /> Diabetes patients - Alli may affect your blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine. <br /> Additional monitoring of your dose or condition may be needed if you are taking amiodarone. <br /> Alli should not be used in children younger than 12 years old; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed. <br /> Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Alli while you are pregnant. It is not known if Alli is found in breast milk. Do not breast-feed while taking Alli.</p><p><strong>Possible Side Effects</strong><br /><br />Check with your doctor if any of these most common side effects persist or become bothersome:&nbsp;<br /> bowel movement urgency; gas with discharge; inability to control bowel movements; increased number of bowel movements; oily discharge; oily or fatty stools; oily spotting. <br /> Seek medical attention right away if any of these severe side effects occur: <br /> severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); severe or persistent stomach pain. <br /><br /><strong>More Information</strong><br /><br />Many individuals really need help with their dieting and Alli can make them the whole process a lot easier, since alli is not just a diet pill, it's actually a weight loss program, a plan to follow, a way to learn how to eat healthy and how to do healthy things for their body, to feel and function better. The one thing that Alli does very well is that it teaches you how to start eating low-fat foods, because Alli works with fats in your body. It blocks them from being absorbed by your digestive system and when that happens, your body does not store fat anymore; it gets rid of it effectively, through your digestive system.</p>
