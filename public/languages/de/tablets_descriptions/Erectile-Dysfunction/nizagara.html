<p><strong>Nizagara<br /></strong><br /><strong>Drug Uses</strong><br /><br />Nizagara is used for treating erectile dysfunction (e.g. male impotence). It works by helping the blood flow into the penis to achieve and maintain an erection during sexual stimulation.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>How to use</strong><br /><br />Nizagara is to be taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before sexual activity. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. Nizagara is not supposed to be taken more often than once per day.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Drug Class and Mechanism</strong><br /><br />Nizagara is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor and it works by helping the blood flow into the penis to achieve and maintain an erection during sexual stimulation.<br /><br /> <strong>Missed Dose</strong><br /><br />Nizagara is to be used as necessary, so you are not supposed to take it according to a schedule.<br /><br /><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Nizagara is to be kept in its original container. It is to be stored at room temperature between 59 and 86 degrees F (15-30 degrees C) away from moisture, heat and light and out of the reach of children.</p><p><strong>Warnings/Precautions</strong><br /><br />Do not take Nizagara, if you are also using a nitrate drug for chest pain or heart problems, including nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, Nitrolingual, Nitro-Dur, Nitro-Bid, Minitran, Deponit, Transderm-Nitro), isosorbide dinitrate (Dilatrate-SR, Isordil, Sorbitrate), and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, ISMO, Monoket), or recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite ("poppers").&nbsp;<br /><br /> Before taking Nizagara, tell your doctor about all other medications you use for erectile dysfunction, or if you are using any of the following medications: <br />bosentan (Tracleer); <br />a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin); <br />cimetidine (Tagamet, Tagamet HB); <br />an antibiotic such as erythromycin (E-Mycin, Eryc, Ery-Tab) or clarithromycin (Biaxin); <br />doxazosin (Cardura), prazosin (Minipress), Terazosin (Hytrin); <br />HIV medicines such as amprenavir (Agenerase), tipranavir (Aptivus), darunavir (Prezista), efavirenz (Sustiva), nevirapine (Viramune), indinavir (Crixivan), saquinavir (Invirase, Fortovase), lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), ritonavir (Norvir), atazanavir (Reyataz), or nelfinavir (Viracept); <br />an antifungal medication such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or ketoconazole (Nizoral); <br />carbamazepine (Tegretol), phenobarbital (Luminal), or phenytoin (Dilantin); or <br />rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane) or rifabutin (Mycobutin). <br /> Tell your doctor about all the prescriptions and over-the-counter medications you use. This includes vitamins, minerals, herbal products, and drugs prescribed by other doctors. Do not start using a new medication without telling your doctor.<br /><br /> If you have heart problems severe enough to make sexual activity a dangerous, you should avoid using Nizagara. Use it cautiously, if you've had a heart attack, stroke, or life-threatening heart irregularities within the past 6 months. Be equally cautious, if you have severe high or low blood pressure, heart failure or unstable angina. <br /><br /> In case of cardiac symptoms developing (for example, dizziness, nausea, and chest pain) during sexual activity, do not continue. Tell your doctor about the problem as soon as possible. <br /><br /> If you have a condition that might result in long-lasting erections, such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma (a disease of the bone marrow), or leukemia, use Nizagara with caution. Also use cautiously if you have a genital problem or deformity such as Peyronie's disease. If an erection lasts more than 4 hours, seek treatment immediately. Permanent damage and impotence could result. <br /><br />If you have a bleeding disorder, a stomach ulcer, or the inherited eye condition known as retinitis pigmentosa, use Nizagara with caution. Its safety under these circumstances has not been studied yet.</p><p><strong>Possible Side Effects</strong><br /><br />If you experience any of the following serious side effects, stop taking Nizagara and seek emergency medical attention or notify your doctor immediately:&nbsp;<br />sudden vision loss; <br />ringing in your ears, or sudden hearing loss; <br />chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; <br />irregular heartbeat; <br />swelling in your hands, ankles, or feet; <br />shortness of breath; <br />vision changes; <br />feeling light-headed, fainting; or <br />penis erection that is painful or lasts 4 hours or longer. <br /> Less serious side effects may include:<br />warmth or redness in your face, neck, or chest; <br />stuffy nose; <br />headache; <br />upset stomach; or <br />back pain. <br /> This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
