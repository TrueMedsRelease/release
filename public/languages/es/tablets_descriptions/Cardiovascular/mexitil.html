Your condition will be monitored closely when you first begin therapy. Often, this drug is first started in a hospital
or other monitored health care setting. Once you are on maintenance therapy, visit your doctor or health care professional
for regular checks on your progress. Because your condition and use of this medicine carry some risk, it is a good idea to
carry an identification card, necklace or bracelet with details of your condition, medications, and doctor or health care professional.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know how
this medicine affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces the risk
of dizzy or fainting spells. Alcohol can make you more dizzy, increase flushing and rapid heartbeats. Avoid alcoholic drinks.
