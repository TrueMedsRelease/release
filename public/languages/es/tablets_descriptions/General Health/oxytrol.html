            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
This medicine is for use on the skin. Follow the directions on the prescription label. Find an area of skin on your abdomen,
hip, or backside that is clean, dry, greaseless, undamaged and hairless. Remove the patch from the sealed pouch. Do not cut
or trim the patch. Using your palm, press the patch firmly in place to make sure that there is good contact with your skin.
Change the patch two times per week, keeping to a regular schedule. When you apply a new patch, use a new area of skin. Wait
at least 1 week before using the same area again.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#
