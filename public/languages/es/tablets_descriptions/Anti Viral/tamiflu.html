If you have the flu, you may be at an increased risk of developing seizures, confusion, or abnormal behavior. This occurs
early in the illness, and more frequently in children and teens. These events are not common, but may result in accidental
injury to the patient. Families and caregivers of patients should watch for signs of unusual behavior and contact a doctor
or health care professional right away if the patient shows signs of unusual behavior.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

This medicine is not a substitute for the flu shot. Talk to your doctor each year about an annual flu shot.
