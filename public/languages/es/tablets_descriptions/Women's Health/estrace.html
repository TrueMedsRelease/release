            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your progress. You will need a regular breast and

This medicine can make your body retain fluid, making your fingers, hands, or ankles swell. Your blood pressure can go
up. Contact your doctor or health care professional if you feel you are retaining fluid.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

If you have any reason to think you are pregnant, stop taking this medicine right away and contact your doctor or health

Smoking increases the risk of getting a blood clot or having a stroke while you are taking this medicine, especially if
you are more than 35 years old. You are strongly advised not to smoke.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

This medicine can increase the risk of developing a condition (endometrial hyperplasia) that may lead to cancer of the
lining of the uterus. Taking progestins, another hormone drug, with this medicine lowers the risk of developing this
condition. Therefore, if your uterus has not been removed (by a hysterectomy), your doctor may prescribe a progestin
for you to take together with your estrogen. You should know, however, that taking estrogens with progestins may have
additional health risks. You should discuss the use of estrogens and progestins with your health care professional to
determine the benefits and risks for you.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

If you are going to have surgery, you may need to stop taking this medicine. Consult your health care professional for
advice before you schedule the surgery.
