            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) that helps prevent your body from absorbing too much salt,
which can cause fluid retention.</br>

Amiloride is a potassium sparing-diuretic that also prevents your body from absorbing too much salt and keeps your
potassium levels from getting too low.</br>

The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride is used to treat fluid retention (edema) and high blood pressure (hypertension).</br>

Hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.

            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Avoid drinking alcohol, which can increase some of the side effects of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride.</br>

Avoid using other medicines that make you light-headed (such as cold medicine, pain medication, muscle relaxers,
and medicine for seizures, depression or anxiety). They can add to the side effects of hydrochlorothiazide and
amiloride. Tell your doctor if you regularly use any of these medicines, or any other blood pressure medications.
Do not use salt substitutes or low-sodium milk products that contain potassium. These products could cause your
potassium levels to get too high while you are taking hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride.</br>

Avoid a diet high in salt. Too much salt will cause your body to retain water and can make this medication less effective.</br>

anything that requires you to be awake and alert.</br>

Avoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather. Follow your doctor's instructions about

drinking enough.
