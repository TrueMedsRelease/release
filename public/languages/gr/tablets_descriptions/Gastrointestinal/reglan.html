            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
It may take a few weeks for your stomach condition to start to get better. However, do not take this medicine for longer
than 12 weeks. The longer you take this medicine, and the more you take it, the greater your chances are of developing serious
side effects. If you are an elderly patient, a female patient, or you have diabetes, you may be at an increased risk for side
effects from this medicine. Contact your doctor immediately if you start having movements you cannot control such as lip smacking,
rapid movements of the tongue, involuntary or uncontrollable movements of the eyes, head, arms and legs, or muscle twitches and spasms.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Patients and their families should watch out for worsening depression or thoughts of suicide. Also watch out for any sudden or
severe changes in feelings such as feeling anxious, agitated, panicky, irritable, hostile, aggressive, impulsive, severely
restless, overly excited and hyperactive, or not being able to sleep. If this happens, especially at the beginning of treatment
or after a change in dose, call your doctor.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Do not treat yourself for high fever. Ask your doctor or health care professional for advice.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this
drug affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or
fainting spells. Alcohol can make you more drowsy and dizzy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.
