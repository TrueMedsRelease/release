This medicine does not prevent heart attack or stroke. In fact, this medicine may increase the chance of a heart attack or
stroke. The chance may increase with longer use of this medicine and in people who have heart disease. If you take aspirin

Do not take medicines such as ibuprofen and naproxen with this medicine. Side effects such as stomach upset, nausea, or ulcers
may be more likely to occur. Many medicines available without a prescription should not be taken with this medicine.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

This medicine can cause ulcers and bleeding in the stomach and intestines at any time during treatment. Do not smoke cigarettes
or drink alcohol. These increase irritation to your stomach and can make it more susceptible to damage from this medicine. Ulcers
and bleeding can happen without warning symptoms and can cause death. #NEXT_LINE_TAG#

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this medicine
affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

This medicine can cause you to bleed more easily. Try to avoid damage to your teeth and gums when you brush or floss your teeth.
