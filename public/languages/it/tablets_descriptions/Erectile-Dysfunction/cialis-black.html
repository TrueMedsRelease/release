<p><strong>What is Cialis Black?</strong></p><p>Cialis Black is a male enhancement medication that is used to treat men with erectile dysfunction. It is a powerful version of one of the more popular medications that is commonly used to treat this problem.</p><p>Unlike other popular products, the effect of the medication is promised to last up to 36 hours.</p><p>As with Cialis, the main active ingredient in Cialis Black is Tadalafil. This product inhibits the body to produce PDE5, a chemical that releases the blood out of the penis during an erection. By inhibiting the production of PDE5, men can maintain erections longer and with a greater blood supply.</p><p><strong>What should I discuss with my doctor before taking Cialis Black?</strong><br /><br />Do not take Cialis Black if you are also using a nitrate drug for chest pain or heart problems. This includes nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, Nitrolingual, Nitro-Dur, Nitro-Bid, and others), isosorbide dinitrate (Dilatrate-SR, Isordil, Sorbitrate), and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, ISMO, Monoket). Nitrates are also found in some recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite ("poppers"). Taking tadalafil with a nitrate medicine can cause a serious decrease in blood pressure, leading to fainting, stroke, or heart attack.<br /><br />A small number of patients have had a sudden loss of eyesight after taking tadalafil. This type of vision loss is caused by decreased blood flow to the optic nerve of the eye. It is not clear whether tadalafil is the actual cause of such vision loss. Sudden vision loss with tadalafil use has occurred most often in people with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or certain pre-existing eye problems, and in those who smoke or are over 50 years old.</p><p><strong>Before taking Cialis Black, tell your doctor if you have:&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong></strong><br />heart disease or heart rhythm problems;<br />a recent history of heart attack (within the past 90 days);<br />a recent history of stroke or congestive heart failure (within the past 6 months);<br />angina (chest pain);<br />high or low blood pressure;<br />liver disease;<br />kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);<br />a blood cell disorder such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia;<br />a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia;<br />a stomach ulcer;<br />retinitis pigmentosa (an inherited condition of the eye);<br />a physical deformity of the penis (such as Peyronie's disease); or<br />if you have been told you should not have sexual intercourse for health reasons.<br /><br />If you have any of these conditions, you may not be able to use tadalafil or you may need a dosage adjustment or special tests during treatment.</p><p><strong>How should I take Cialis Black?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Cialis Black is safe to take for most healthy men when used as directed. It is strongly recommended that you inform your doctor about all the medications, herbal products and vitamin supplements you take on a regular basis. Plus, if you have a pre-existing health condition such as heart disease, high blood pressure, liver or kidney disease, blood cell disorders, hypertension or if you have had a stroke or heart attack in the past six months.</p><p>Take Cialis Black at least 20 to 60 minutes before sexual activity.

Discuss the use of grapefruit products with your doctor. Do not increase or decrease the amount of grapefruit products in your diet without first talking to your doctor.<br />Do not use any other drug to treat impotence, such as alprostadil (Caverject, Muse, Edex) or yohimbine (Yocon, Yodoxin, others), unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p><strong>What are the possible side effects of Cialis Black?</strong></p><p>There are some serious side effects that are possible although they are very rare. If you notice any changes in your vision you should contact your physician immediately and stop using this medication. There is also a chance that you may experience dizziness, chest pain or nausea while engaging in sexual activity after consuming Cialis Black. If this does occur, do not engage in further sexual activity until you have called the prescribing physician.</p><p>There are some side effects that can occur that should be reported to your doctor. As with any medication, if you begin having signs of an allergic reaction contact the closest emergency room. Breathing problems, hearing deficits, irregular heartbeat or chest pains are all possible side effects that should not be ignored.<br /><br />Side effects that do not necessarily need to be reported to the physician include back pain, dizziness, indigestion or headaches.</p><p>While most men will not experience any side effects from this product, there is a small chance that some men will experience one or more of the side effects listed as follows:<br />Headache;<br />Indigestion;<br />Back Pain;<br />Muscle Aches;<br />Flushing;<br />Stuffy or Runny Nose.<br /><br />The side effects listed here are caused by the effects of the active ingredient, Tadalafil.
