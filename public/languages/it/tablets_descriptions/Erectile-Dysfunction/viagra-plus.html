These erectile tissues consist of venous blood vessels with a high muscle content and they are controlled like the other muscular organs of the body (such as the heart) not deliberately, but through a specific nervous system (the vegetative nervous system).&nbsp;<br /><br /> Hormones, blood vessels, nerves, and muscles must all work together to make an erection. Your brain starts an erection by sending nerve signals to the penis when it senses sexual stimulation.<br /><br /> We guarantee that Viagra Plus works in a quite different way and it works for everyone who experiences the effects of erectile dysfunction.

Now, it is your turn to act and enjoy the marvelous aspects of your sexual life. <br /><br /><strong>Drug Class and Mechanism</strong><br /><br />The incomparable effect of Viagra Plus is achieved with the following ingredients:<br /><br />Sildenafil is a proven and reliable phosphodiesterase inhibitor that relaxes muscles and increases blood flow to particular areas of the body. <br /><br /> Ginseng is one of the essential ingredients of Viagra Plus. Ginseng has traditionally been used for fighting fatigue, providing immune support. Ginseng helps maintain stamina and energy levels and may enhance physical performance.<br /> Fights Fatigue; <br /> Supports Immune System; <br /> Improves Memory and Concentration; <br /> Enhances Physical and Mental Performance; <br /> Increases Energy; <br /> Supports and Stimulates Efficient Adrenal Function; <br /> Helps with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. <br /><br />L-Arginine is used to make the nitric oxide, a compound in the body that relaxes blood vessels. Preliminary studies have found that L-Arginine may help with conditions that improve when blood vessels are relaxed (called vasodilation). Together with reduction of blood vessel stiffness, increase of blood flow, L-Argine improves blood vessel function and stimulates the release of human growth hormone and prolactin. <br /><br />Vitamin B-6 is an antioxidant nutrient that helps the body inhibit the formation of damaging free radicals. Excess homocysteine causes atherosclerosis (thickening and hardening of the artery walls) and an adequate supply of Vitamin B-6 will prevent the accumulation of this toxic metabolite. B-6 deficiency can weaken the heart muscle and raise serum cholesterol levels. Vitamin B-6 is very important for the metabolism of amino acids - most people should be taking some of this nutrient, this is why it activates L-Arginine in the most proper way.<br /><br />Vitamin B-12 is necessary for the production of red blood cells and plays an important role in maintaining the health of nerve cells and in the formation of genetic material. <br /><br />Folic Acid is an essential vitamin B that plays an important role in DNA and RNA synthesis, production of red blood cells, cardiovascular health, mood, mental functioning and maintenance of the nervous system. Adequate levels of folate help to maintain healthy levels of homocysteine, supporting cardiovascular health. The form of folate used in supplements is absorbed better than that found in food. <br /><br /><strong>Missed Dose</strong><br /><br />If you miss a dose of Viagra Plus, take it as soon as you remember.
