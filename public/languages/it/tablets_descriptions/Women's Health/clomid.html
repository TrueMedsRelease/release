            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Make sure you understand how and when to use this medicine. You need to know when you are ovulating and when to have sexual
intercourse. This will increase the chance of a pregnancy.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your progress. You may need tests to check the hormone
levels in your blood or you may have to use home-urine tests to check for ovulation. Try to keep any appointments.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Compared to other fertility treatments, this medicine does not greatly increase your chances of having multiple babies. An
increased chance of having twins may occur in roughly 5 out of every 100 women who take this medication.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Stop taking this medicine at once and contact your doctor or health care professional if you think you are pregnant.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

This medicine is not for long-term use. Most women that benefit from this medicine do so within the first three cycles
(months). Your doctor or health care professional will monitor your condition. This medicine is usually used for a total

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know how
this drug affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

tobacco use during your fertility treatments.
