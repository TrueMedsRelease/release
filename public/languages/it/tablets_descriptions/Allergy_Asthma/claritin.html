            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
            Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if your symptoms do not start to get better or if they get worse.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

            Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy, and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact
            your doctor if the problem does not go away or is severe.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

            You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know
            how this medicine affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces
            the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.
