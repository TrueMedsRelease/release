            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#How should I use this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
            Take this medicine by mouth with a full glass of water. Follow the directions on the prescription label. Take
            it with food. If you are taking this medicine to prevent  malaria, you should start taking it one week before
            entering the area, and continue for 4 weeks after leaving. Take your doses at regular intervals and on the same
            day of each week. Do not take your medicine more often than directed. If you are treating an acute malaria infection,
            you will receive a single dose of the drug. For prolonged travel in an area where malaria is common, consult your
            healthcare provider for proper dosing schedule.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
            Tell your doctor or health care professional if your symptoms do not start to get better in a few days. If you are
            taking this medicine for a long time, visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks. If you
            notice any changes in your vision see your eye doctor for an eye exam.

            If you get a fever during or after you start taking this medicine, do not treat yourself. Contact your doctor
            or health care professional immediately.

            You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you
            know how this medicine affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This
            reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.

            While in areas where malaria is common, you should take steps to prevent being bit by mosquitos. This includes
            staying in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms to reduce human-mosquito contact, sleep under mosquito netting,
            preferably one with pyrethrum-containing insecticide, wear long-sleeved shirts or blouses and long trousers to protect
            arms and legs, apply mosquito repellents containing DEET to uncovered areas of skin, and use a pyrethrum-containing
            flying insect spray to kill mosquitos.

            If you are currently taking or have taken this medicine in the past 3 weeks, you should not take halofantrine (another
            malarial drug). Dangerous heart side effects may occur. Talk to your health care provider.
