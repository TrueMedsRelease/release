            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your progress. Continue to take your tablets even if
you do not feel better right away. It can take 1 to 2 weeks or longer before you start to feel the effects of this medicine.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Patients and their families should watch out for worsening depression or thoughts of suicide. Also watch out for sudden
or severe changes in feelings such as feeling anxious, agitated, panicky, irritable, hostile, aggressive, impulsive, severely
restless, overly excited and hyperactive, or not being able to sleep. If this happens, especially at the beginning of treatment
or after a change in dose, call your health care professional.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

If you have been taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not suddenly stop taking it. You must gradually reduce the
dose, or your symptoms may get worse. Ask your doctor or health care professional for advice.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this
medicine affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy
or fainting spells. Alcohol may interfere with the effect of this medicine. Avoid alcoholic drinks.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Do not treat yourself for coughs, colds, or allergies without asking your doctor or health care professional for advice. Some
ingredients can increase possible side effects.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy, and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your
doctor if the problem does not go away or is severe.
