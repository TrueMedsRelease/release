Ginseng also increases more successfully erections, sexual desire and intercourse in comparison with placebo. <br /><br /><strong>How to use</strong><br /><br />Not getting an erection at the desired moment is usually called erectile dysfunction (ED) or sometimes impotence. Erectile dysfunction is a better description because the problem can usually be solved. In fact, nearly all men suffer from erectile dysfunction from time to time.&nbsp;<br /><br /> In clinical trials Levitra Plus has shown amazing results, being effective in a majority of men with mild to severe ED. Observing the work of Levitra Plus, we've found out that the response period was minimized to 7 minutes and the full efficacy of erectile dysfunction treatment was achieved. <br /><br /> Besides, Levitra Plus has shown the reduction of unpleasant side effects that people usually experience, taking phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, with the help of detoxifying herbs and vitamins, needed in your busy everyday life.<br /> <br /><strong>Drug Class and Mechanism</strong><br /><br />The incomparable effect of Levitra Plus is achieved with the following ingredients:<br /><br /> Vardenafil  is a novel selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that relaxes muscles and increases blood flow to particular areas of the body, characterized by high efficacy and low adverse-event profile. <br /><br /> Ginseng is one of the essential ingredients of Levitra Plus. Ginseng has traditionally been used for fighting fatigue, providing immune support. Ginseng helps maintain stamina and energy levels and may enhance physical performance.<br /> Fights Fatigue; <br /> Supports Immune System; <br /> Improves Memory and Concentration; <br /> Enhances Physical and Mental Performance; <br /> Increases Energy; <br /> Supports and Stimulates Efficient Adrenal Function; <br /> Helps with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. <br /><br />L-Arginine is used to make the nitric oxide, a compound in the body that relaxes blood vessels. Preliminary studies have found that L-Arginine may help with conditions that improve when blood vessels are relaxed (called vasodilation). Together with reduction of blood vessel stiffness L-Arginine increases blood flow, improves blood vessel function and stimulates the release of human growth hormone and prolactin. <br /><br />Ginseng stimulates and increases endocrine activity in the body. It promotes an increase in metabolic activity and relaxes heart and artery movements. Ginseng stimulates the medulla centers and relaxes the central nervous system. Ginseng increases successful erections, sexual desire and successful intercourse comparing to placebo. <br /><br />Vitamin B-6 is an antioxidant nutrient that helps the body inhibit the formation of damaging free radicals. Excess homocysteine causes atherosclerosis (thickening and hardening of the artery walls) and an adequate supply of Vitamin B-6 will prevent the accumulation of this toxic metabolite. B-6 deficiency can weaken the heart muscle and raise serum cholesterol levels. Vitamin B-6 is very important for the metabolism of amino acids - most people should be taking some of this nutrient, this is why it activates L-Arginine in the most proper way.<br /><br />Vitamin B-12 is necessary for the production of red blood cells and plays an important role in maintaining the health of nerve cells and in the formation of genetic material. <br /><br />Folic Acid is an essential vitamin B that plays an important role in DNA and RNA synthesis, production of red blood cells, cardiovascular health, mood, mental functioning and maintenance of the nervous system. Adequate levels of folate help to maintain healthy levels of homocysteine, supporting cardiovascular health. The form of folate used in supplements get absorbed better than ones found in foods. <br /><br /><strong>Missed Dose</strong><br /><br />If you miss a dose of Levitra Plus, take it as soon as you remember.
