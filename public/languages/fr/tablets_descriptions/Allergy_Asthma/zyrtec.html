            #TITLE_OPEN_TAG#What should I watch for while using this medicine?#TITLE_CLOSE_TAG#
            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
            Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your health. Tell your doctor if
            your symptoms do not improve.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

            You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until
            you know how this medicine affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older
            patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy or fainting spells.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

            Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy, and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact
            your doctor if the problem does not go away or is severe.
