    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Omnicef may cause drowsiness or dizziness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Omnicef with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Omnicef only works against bacteria; it does not treat viral infections (eg, the common cold).
    <br>Be sure to use Omnicef for the full course of treatment. If you do not, the medicine may not clear up your infection completely. The bacteria could also become less sensitive to this or other medicines. This could make the infection harder to treat in the future.
    <br>Long-term or repeated use of Omnicef may cause a second infection. Tell your doctor if signs of a second infection occur. Your medicine may need to be changed to treat this.
    <br>Contact your doctor right away if stomach pain or cramps, severe diarrhea, or bloody stools occur. Do not treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor.
    <br>If you are taking Omnicef and a product that contains iron, your stools may turn a reddish color. This is normal and not a cause for concern.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Omnicef may cause the results of some tests for urine ketones or glucose to be wrong. Ask your doctor before you change your diet or the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Omnicef may interfere with certain lab tests (eg, Coomb tests). Be sure your doctor and lab personnel know you are using Omnicef.
    <br>Use Omnicef with extreme caution in children younger 10 years old who have diarrhea or an infection of the stomach or bowel.
    <br>Omnicef should be used with extreme caution in children younger than 6 months old; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Omnicef while you are pregnant. It is not known if Omnicef is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you using Omnicef, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to your baby.
