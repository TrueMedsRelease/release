<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Doxazosin is an alpha-adrenergic (AL-fa ad-ren-ER-jik) blockers. It relaxes your veins and arteries so that blood can more easily pass through them. It also relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate. Doxazosin is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), or to improve urination in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate). The extended-release form of doxazosin is for use only in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia and should not be used to treat hypertension.
