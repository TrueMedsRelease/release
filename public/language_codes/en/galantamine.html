<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Galantamine is used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's type dementia. Galantamine improves the function of nerve cells in the brain. It works by preventing the breakdown of a chemical called acetylcholine (ah see til KO leen). People with dementia usually have lower levels of this chemical, which is important for the processes of memory, thinking, and reasoning.
