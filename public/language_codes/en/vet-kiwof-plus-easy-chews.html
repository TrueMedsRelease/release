<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Give Kiwof Plus Easy Chews exactly as directed by your veterinarian, in the recommended dose and duration. It can usually be given with or without food, but administering it with food may help reduce stomach discomfort. Ensure your pet swallows the full dose, and repeat deworming as advised by your veterinarian to prevent reinfection.

<strong>Possible side effect</strong>

<br> Kiwof Plus is generally well tolerated and does not usually cause any side effects. However, some pets may experience mild side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite. These effects are usually temporary and resolve on their own. If symptoms persist, worsen, or if your pet shows signs of an allergic reaction, such as swelling or difficulty breathing, contact your veterinarian immediately.
