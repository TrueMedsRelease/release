<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Opticare Ointment (Cyclosporin) contains cyclosporine and is used to treat certain eye conditions. Cyclosporine is a polypeptide agent and is effective at treating either eye infections or cases of chronic dry eye. It works by stimulating the tear glands resulting in increased tear production.
