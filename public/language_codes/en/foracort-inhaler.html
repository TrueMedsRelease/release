<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Foracort Inhaler is a combination medication used to manage and relieve long-term symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It contains two active ingredients, formoterol and budesonide, which work together to improve breathing. Formoterol helps relax the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe, while budesonide reduces inflammation by inhibiting the release of chemicals that cause swelling in the airways.

<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Before using the nebuliser for the first time or after a while, shake it for about 5 to 10 seconds. To clear your lungs and take a deep breath, completely exhale. Hold the inhaler erect with your thumb on the base and index and middle fingers on the top. Remove the cap from the mouthpiece. Put the tip there and seal your lips around it. Inhale slowly and deeply through your mouth while applying pressure to the inhaler to release the medicine. As long as you can easily hold your breath, remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for approximately 10 seconds. If your healthcare provider advises it, exhale carefully before starting over. Rinse your mouth with water after using the inhaler to reduce the possibility of developing a fungal illness in the mouth and throat.
