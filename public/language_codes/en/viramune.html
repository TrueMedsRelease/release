<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Viramune is an antiviral medication that prevents human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cells from multiplying in your body. Viramune is used to treat HIV, which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Viramune is usually taken only once daily for the first 2 weeks, and then increased to twice daily. Starting with a low dose can reduce your risk of skin reactions. Follow your doctor's instructions about how often to take the medication.
<br> If you stop taking Viramune for longer than 7 days, call your doctor before you start taking the medicine again. You may have to start with a lower dose.
<br> Take Viramune with a full glass of water. You may also take the medicine with milk or a soft drink. Viramune can be taken with or without food.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Do not use this medication if you are allergic to Viramune, or if you have moderate to severe liver disease.
<br> Do not take Viramune as your only HIV medication. HIV/AIDS is usually treated with a combination of different drugs. Avoid drinking alcohol. Avoid having unprotected sex or sharing razors or toothbrushes.
