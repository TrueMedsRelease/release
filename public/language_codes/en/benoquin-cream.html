<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Benoquin Cream is indicated for final depigmentation in extensive Vitiligo. Benoquin Cream is applied topically to permanently depigment normal skin surrounding vitiliginous lesions in patients with disseminated (greater than 50 percent of body surface area) idiopathic vitiligo.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> A thin layer of Benoquin Cream should be applied and rubbed into the pigmented area two or three times daily, or as directed by physician. Prolonged exposure to sunlight should be avoided during treatment with Benoquin Cream, or a sunscreen should be used. Depigmentation is usually accomplished after one to four months of Benoquin Cream treatment. If satisfactory results are not obtained after four months of Benoquin Cream treatment, the drug should be discontinued. When the desired degree of depigmentation is obtained, Benoquin Cream should be applied only as often as needed to maintain depigmentation (usually only two times weekly).

<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Benoquin Cream is a potent depigmenting agent, not a mild cosmetic bleach. Do not use except for final depigmentation in extensive vitiligo.
<br> Benoquin Cream is for External Use Only. Following therapy with Benoquin Cream, the skin will be sensitive for the rest of the patient’s life. He/she must use sunscreens during exposure to the sun.

<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Benoquin Cream contains a potent depigmenting agent and is not a cosmetic skin bleach. Use of Benoquin Cream is contraindicated in any conditions other than disseminated vitiligo. Benoquin Cream frequently produces irreversible depigmentation, and it must not be used as a substitute for hydroquinone.
<br> Benoquin Cream is also contraindicated in individuals with a history of sensitivity or allergic reactions to this product, or any of its ingredients.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Mild, transient skin irritation and sensitization, including erythematous and eczematous reactions have occurred following topical application of Benoquin Cream. Although those reactions are usually transient, treatment with Benoquin Cream should be discontinued if irritation, a burning sensation, or dermatitis occur. Areas of normal skin distant to the site of Benoquin Cream application frequently have become depigmented, and irregular, excessive, unsightly, and frequently permanent depigmentation has occurred.
