<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Apresoline is a vasodilator that works by relaxing the muscles in your blood vessels to help them dilate (widen). This lowers blood pressure and allows blood to flow more easily through your veins and arteries. Apresoline is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).
<br>
<br>
