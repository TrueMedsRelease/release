<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Penegra is applied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (impotence) in men and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The main component of Penegra is Sildenafil. Sildenafil affects the response to sexual stimulation. It acts by enhancing smooth muscle relaxation using nitric oxide, a chemical that is normally released in response to sexual stimulation. This smooth muscle relaxation allows increased blood flow into certain areas of the penis, which leads to an erection.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> It is taken by mouth with a glass of water approximately 0,5-1 hour before sexual activity. Penegra should not be taken more than once a day. A high fat meal may delay the time of the effect of this drug. Try not to eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are being treated with Sildenafil.
