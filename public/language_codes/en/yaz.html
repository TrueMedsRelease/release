<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Yaz tablets contain a combination of progesterone (drospirenone) and estrogen (ethinyl estradiol). Yaz is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy. It is also used to treat moderate acne in women who are at least 14 years old and have started having menstrual periods, and who wish to use birth control pills.
<br> Yaz is also used to treat the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), such as anxiety, depression, irritability, trouble concentrating, lack of energy, sleep or appetite changes, breast tenderness, joint or muscle pain, headache, and weight gain.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Yaz exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Take your first pill on the first day of your period or on the first Sunday after your period begins. You may need to use back-up birth control, such as condoms with spermicide, when you first start using this medication.
<br> Take one pill every day, no more than 24 hours apart. When the pills run out, start a new pack the following day. You could get pregnant if you do not take one pill daily.
