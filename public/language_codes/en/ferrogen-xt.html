<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Ferrogen xt is commonly used to treat iron deficiency and anaemia, including conditions like menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and folate deficiency anaemia. Iron helps boost red blood cell production, while folic acid supports overall blood health. Folic acid is also important during pregnancy, as it helps reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Additionally, this combination is beneficial for people with poor diets, digestive issues, or conditions that affect iron absorption, helping improve energy levels and overall health by preventing or treating iron and folate deficiencies.
