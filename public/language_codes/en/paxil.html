            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Visit your doctor or health care professional for regular checks on your progress. Continue to take your medicine even
if you do not immediately feel better. It can take several weeks before you feel the full effect of this medicine.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Patients and their families should watch out for depression or thoughts of suicide that get worse. Also watch out for
sudden or severe changes in feelings such as feeling anxious, agitated, panicky, irritable, hostile, aggressive, impulsive,
severely restless, overly excited and hyperactive, or not being able to sleep. If this happens, especially at the beginning
of antidepressant treatment or after a change in dose, call your health care professional.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

If you have been taking this medicine regularly for some time, do not suddenly stop taking it. You must gradually reduce the
dose or your symptoms may get worse. Ask your doctor or health care professional for advice.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know how this
medicine affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces the risk of dizzy
or fainting spells. Alcohol can increase or decrease the effects of this medicine. Avoid alcoholic drinks.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Do not treat yourself for coughs, colds or allergies without asking your doctor or health care professional for advice. Some
ingredients can increase possible side effects.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy, and drinking plenty of water will help.
