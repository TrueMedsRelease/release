<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Folitas (Folic Acid) is a vital nutrient used to treat anaemia caused by a deficiency of folic acid in both adults and children. It is commonly prescribed during pregnancy, in cases where red blood cells are damaged, and for patients undergoing kidney dialysis who may experience reduced folic acid levels. This essential nutritional supplement also plays a crucial role in preventing spina bifida, a serious congenital abnormality affecting the spine, in babies during pregnancy.
