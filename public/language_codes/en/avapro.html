<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br> Antihypertensive drug, antagonist of angiotensin receptors II. It specifically and irreversibly blocks receptors of angiotensin which leads to diminishing of biological effects of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II effects include vasoconstriction and stimulating influence on excretion of aldosterone and activation of sympathetic nervous system.
