<br> To apply Besivance eye drops: Turn the bottle upside down and shake it once before each use. Tilt your head back slightly and pull down your lower eyelid to create a small pocket. Hold the dropper above the eye with the dropper tip down. Look up and away from the dropper as you squeeze out a drop, then close your eye.
