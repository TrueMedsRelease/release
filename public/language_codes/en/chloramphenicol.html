    <br>if you have allergies to medicines, foods, or other substances

    <br>Some medicines may interact with Chloramphenicol. Tell your health care provider if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of the following:
    <br>Anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) because side effects, including risk of bleeding, may be increased
    <br>Hydantoins (eg, phenytoin) or sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide) because the actions and side effects of these medicines may be increased.
    <br>Medicines that may decrease your bone marrow (eg, cancer chemotherapy ) because the risk of serious side effects, such as low blood platelet levels and low white blood cell counts, may be increased; check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure if any of your medicines may decrease your bone marrow.

    <br>
    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Do not exceed the recommended dose or use Chloramphenicol for longer than prescribed without checking with your doctor.
    <br>Chloramphenicol is effective only against bacteria. It is not effective for treating viral infections (eg, the common cold).
    <br>It is important to use Chloramphenicol for the full course of treatment. Failure to do so may decrease the effectiveness of Chloramphenicol and increase the risk that the bacteria will no longer be sensitive to Chloramphenicol and will not be able to be treated by this or certain other antibiotics in the future.
    <br>Long-term or repeated use of Chloramphenicol may cause a second infection. Your doctor may want to change your medicine to treat the second infection. Contact your doctor if signs of a second infection occur.
    <br>If symptoms of "gray syndrome" (swelling of the abdomen, pale or blue skin color, vomiting, shock, difficulty breathing, refusal to suck, loose green stools, limp muscles, low temperature) occur in a newborn or infant, contact your doctor. Death may occur within hours of the onset of symptoms. Stopping use of Chloramphenicol when symptoms first appear increases the chance for a complete recovery.
    <br>Chloramphenicol may lower your body's ability to fight infection. Prevent infection by avoiding contact with people with colds or other infections. Notify your doctor of any signs of infection, including fever, sore throat, rash, or chills.
    <br>Chloramphenicol may reduce the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your blood. To prevent bleeding, avoid situations in which bruising or injury may occur. Report any unusual bleeding, bruising, blood in stools, or dark, tarry stools to your doctor.
    <br>Diabetes patients - Chloramphenicol may affect your blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely and ask your doctor before adjusting the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>LAB TESTS, including complete blood cell counts, may be performed to monitor your progress or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use Chloramphenicol with extreme caution in children younger 1 year. Safety and effectiveness in this age group have not been confirmed.
    <br>Use Chloramphenicol with extreme caution in children younger 10 years who have diarrhea or a stomach or bowel infection.
    <br>Use Chloramphenicol with extreme caution in premature and full-term infants because they may be more sensitive to the effects of Chloramphenicol, especially the risk of "gray syndrome."
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant while taking Chloramphenicol, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of using Chloramphenicol during pregnancy. Chloramphenicol should be used with extreme caution during full-term pregnancy and labor because the fetus may experience severe side effects. Chloramphenicol is excreted in breast milk. Do not breastfeed while taking Chloramphenicol.
