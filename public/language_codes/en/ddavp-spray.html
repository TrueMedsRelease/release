<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> DDAVP is a man-made form of a hormone that occurs naturally in the pituitary gland. This hormone affects blood pressure, kidney function, and regulating how the body uses water. DDAVP is used to treat central cranial diabetes insipidus, and increased thirst and urination caused by head surgery or head trauma.

<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Before your first use, prime the nasal spray with 4 to 5 test sprays into the air. Prime again whenever the spray hasn't been used in longer than 3 days. Keep track of how many sprays you've used from each bottle. Each brand of desmopressin nasal contains a specific number of sprays per bottle.
<br> Limit your intake of water and other fluids while you are using DDAVP. Drinking too much water can cause your body to lose sodium, which may lead to a serious, life-threatening electrolyte imbalance.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Tell your doctor if you have: nasal problems such as a runny or stuffy nose; a psychologic disorder that causes extreme or unusual thirst; an infection or illness with fever, vomiting, or diarrhea; congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease; kidney disease or being unable to urinate; a head injury or brain tumor; cystic fibrosis; or diabetes.
<br> It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. DDAVP should not be used to treat excessive urination that is a normal condition of pregnancy.
<br> It may not be safe to breastfeed a baby while you are using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risks.
<br> DDAVP may be less effective if you have any swelling or scarring inside your nose, or any nasal or sinus problems (such as deviated septum).
