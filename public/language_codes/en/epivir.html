<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Epivir is an antiviral medicine that prevents human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus from multiplying in your body. Epivir is for treating HIV in adults and children at least 3 months old. HIV is the virus that can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Lamivudine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Epivir exactly as prescribed by your doctor. You should not take Epivir (for treating HIV) together with Epivir-HBV (for treating hepatitis B). You may take this medicine with or without food. Lamivudine doses are based on weight. Your dose needs may change if the gains or loses weight.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Tell your doctor if you have ever had: liver disease (especially hepatitis B or C, or a liver transplant); pancreatitis; kidney disease; or diabetes (liquid lamivudine contains 3 to 4 grams of sucrose per dose).
<br> You may develop lactic acidosis, a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. This may be more likely if you have other medical conditions, if you've taken HIV medication for a long time, or if you are a woman. Ask your doctor about your risk.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not take Epivir if you are allergic to lamivudine.
<br> Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, and use your medications properly to control your infection. HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy.
<br> Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.
