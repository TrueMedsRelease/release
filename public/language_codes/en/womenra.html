    <strong>What is the difference between Womenra and Viagra?</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Womenra Female Viagra contains sidlenafil as its active substance; sildenafil is the same ingredient as makes the basis of the classical Viagra pill. The drug works by improving the blood inflow to the vagina; in men the same mechanism facilitates development and maintenance of erections. In women, improved blood flow in the genital region heightens the sensitivity and consequentially the response towards direct stimulation of the clitoris.
    <br>The tissues of clitoris are of the same cavernous nature as those found in the penis, which explains the suitability of vasoactive drug application in females. The engorging ot the clitoris is sometimes referred to as “clitoral erection” and it follows the neurovascular mechanisms that are similar to those of the male genital apparatus.
    <br>The increase in the amount of blood circulating in the genitals stimulates the work of Bartholin’s glands that are responsible for vaginal lubrication. This makes Womenra or Lovegra a product ideal for women experiencing vaginal dryness due to physiological constitution or climacteric / menopausal changes.
