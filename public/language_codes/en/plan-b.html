<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Plan B is an over-the-counter emergency contraceptive pill used to help prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure, including a broken condom, missed birth control pills. Plan B (levonorgestrel) works by temporarily delaying ovulation (the release of an egg), which helps prevent pregnancy before it can happen.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Plan B One-Step (levonorgestrel 1.5 mg) is one tablet that is taken once.  It must be taken as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex. The sooner the tablet is taken, the better it works.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Ask a doctor or pharmacist before taking levonorgestrel if you regularly use medication for seizures, tuberculosis, or HIV/AIDS. Certain medications can make levonorgestrel less effective as an emergency form of contraception.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br> Do not use this medicine if you are already pregnant. Levonorgestrel will not terminate a pregnancy that has already begun (the fertilized egg has attached to the uterus).
<br> You should not use Plan B  if you are allergic to levonorgestrel or any of the ingredients in this medicine.
<br>
