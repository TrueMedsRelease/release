<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Aggrenox contains a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. Aspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicylates (sa-LIS-il-ates). It works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation. Dipyridamole keeps platelets in your blood from sticking together to form clots. Aggrenox is used to reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had blood clots or a "mini-stroke" (also called a transient ischemic attack or TIA).

Do not chew, break, or open an extended-release capsule. Swallow the capsule whole. Do not stop taking Aggrenox unless your doctor tells you to.

<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> This medicine can make it easier for you to bleed, even from a minor injury such as a fall or a bump on the head. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you fall or hit your head, or have any bleeding that will not stop.
<br> If you need surgery or dental work, tell the surgeon or dentist ahead of time that you are using Aggrenox. You may need to stop for a short time to prevent excessive bleeding.
<br> If you need a stress test for your heart, tell your healthcare provider you are taking Aggrenox. You may need to stop taking this medicine 48 hours before your test.
<br> Avoid drinking alcohol while you are taking Aggrenox. Alcohol may increase your risk of stomach bleeding.
