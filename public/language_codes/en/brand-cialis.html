<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br> Brand Cialis was developed by the pharmaceutical company LILLY and contains Tadalafil as its main component.<br> Cialis is an effective, reversible, selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) specific to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). When sexual stimulation causes local release of nitric oxide, inhibition of PDE 5 by Cialis leads to increase of cGMP levels in the cavernous body of penis. It results in relaxation of arterial smooth muscles and blood flow to the tissues of the penis that causes erections. Cialis has no effect when sexual stimulation is absent. Cialis improves erection and helps to achieve a successful sexual intercourse. The drug acts during 36 hours. If sexual arousal is present the effect appears even after 16 minutes after the medication was taken.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction</strong><br><br> The recommended dose of Cialis is 20 mg. It should be taken at least 16 minutes before the sexual activity. The effect persists during 36 hours. Take Cialis once daily and do not exceed the recommended dose.<br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> It is preferable not to use Cialis with grapefruit juice, alcoholic beverages, tobacco. If you smoke tobacco and take Cialis concomitantly this may lead to a condition called NAION (sudden optic nerve-related vision loss).

In more rare cases low blood pressure, blurred vision and changes in color vision, and abnormal ejaculation may occur. Prolonged erections or priapism (painful erections lasting more than 6 hours) are also possible.
