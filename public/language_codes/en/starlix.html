<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Starlix is an oral diabetes medicine that helps control blood sugar levels. This medicine helps your body respond better to insulin produced by your pancreas. Starlix is used together with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This medicine is not for treating type 1 diabetes.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Starlix exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Starlix is usually taken 3 times daily, within 1 to 30 minutes before a meal. If you skip a meal, do not take your dose of Starlix. Wait until your next meal.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> To make sure Starlix is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have: liver disease; or gout.
<br> Follow your doctor's instructions about using Starlix if you are pregnant or you become pregnant. Controlling diabetes is very important during pregnancy, and having high blood sugar may cause complications in both the mother and the baby.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not use Starlix if you are allergic to nateglinide, or if you have ever had: diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment).
<br> You should not breastfeed while using nateglinide.
<br> Starlix is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.
<br> Avoid drinking alcohol. It lowers blood sugar and may interfere with your diabetes treatment.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Starlix: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
<br> Call your doctor at once if you have: seizure (convulsions); or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
<br> Common Starlix side effects may include: runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, cough, cold or flu symptoms; diarrhea; back pain; dizziness; or joint pain or stiffness.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Many other medicines can affect your blood sugar, and some medicines can increase or decrease the effects of Starlix. Some drugs can also cause you to have fewer symptoms of hypoglycemia, making it harder to tell when your blood sugar is low. Tell each of your health care providers about all medicines you use now and any medicine you start or stop using. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek emergency medical attention. You may have signs of low blood sugar, such as extreme weakness, blurred vision, sweating, trouble speaking, tremors, stomach pain, confusion, and seizure (convulsions).
