<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Eldepryl is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. This is a case of the brain that affects motion. People with Parkinson's disease do not have enough nerve cells in the part of the brain that controls movement. These nerve cells produce a substance called dopamine. It is a lack of dopamine which causes problems with movement. Eldepryl tablets keep dopamine around longer, helping with difficulties in movement. Eldepryl has no anti-Parkinson effects of its own and must always be given in combination with levodopa/carbidopa.

Lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting may intervene, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. So you may get up slowly, but if the problem continues or gets worse, consult to your doctor.
