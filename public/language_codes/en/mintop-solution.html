<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Open the cap of the bottle. Insert the spray and screw the cap firmly to the bottle. Make sure your scalp is clean and dry before applying the serum. Part your hair into small sections to expose the scalp. Spray it 5-6 times over the entire scalp so that the product evenly spreads. Alternatively, insert the dropper and squeeze the rubber bulb. Release the bulb till the solution fills up to 1ml mark and apply over the affected area. Massage gently with the fingers. Keep it out of eyes, ears, and mouth. If contact occurs, rinse away with plenty of cold water. Wash your hands before and after use.
