<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> P-Force Plus is a medication designed to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED), a common issue impacting many men. It belongs to the class of Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. The active ingredient in this Erectile Dysfunction solution is Sildenafil Citrate, which works by enhancing penile blood flow and helping men have and keep an erection during sexual activity. This makes it a successful sexual performance booster and sexual vitality enhancement tool.

<br> Take P-Force Plus about 30 minutes to 1 hour before sexual activity. Swallow the tablet whole with water. For Erectile Dysfunction, it is best to take P-Force Plus on an empty stomach.
