<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Serevent is used to prevent asthma attacks or exercise-induced bronchospasm. It is also used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Serevent is a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) bronchodilator. It works by helping the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to improve breathing.
<br> Serevent is not used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace a rescue inhaler.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use Serevent exactly as it was prescribed for you. Serevent inhalations should not be used more often than prescribed (twice per day) and proper techniques of inhalation closely followed. Use Serevent regularly to get the most benefit.
