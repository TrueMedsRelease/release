<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Ciloxan (Ciprofloxacin, for use in the eyes) is used to treat bacterial infections of the eyes. Ciloxan is also used to treat an ulcer in the cornea of the eye. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone (flor-o-KWIN-o-lone) antibiotic that fights bacteria in the body. Ciprofloxacin will not treat a viral or fungal infection of the eye. Ciloxan is for use in treating only bacterial infections.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Follow all directions on your prescription label. If you wear contact lenses, remove them before applying Ciloxan. Ask your doctor if contact lenses can be reinserted after application of the medication. Wash your hands before using eye medication.
<br> To apply the eye drops: Tilt your head back slightly and pull down your lower eyelid to create a small pocket. Hold the dropper above the eye with the tip down. Look up and away from the dropper and squeeze out a drop. Close your eyes for 2 or 3 minutes with your head tipped down, without blinking or squinting. Gently press your finger to the inside corner of the eye for about 1 minute, to keep the liquid from draining into your tear duct. Use only the number of drops your doctor has prescribed. If you use more than one drop, wait about 5 minutes between drops. Wait at least 10 minutes before using any other eye drops your doctor has prescribed.
