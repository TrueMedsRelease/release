<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Cephavet is a broad-spectrum antibiotic for dogs and cats, used to treat various bacterial infections like skin/soft tissue (wounds, abscesses), urinary tract, respiratory tract, and bone/joint infections, as well as pyometra in dogs, by stopping bacterial cell wall growth.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Administered orally as tablets at doses like 22-30 mg/kg twice daily, but always follow your veterinarian's specific instructions, often continuing for several days after symptoms improve.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> The safety of Cephavet has not been established in pregnant or lactating animals. Use only based on a risk/benefit assessment by a veterinarian. Pets with kidney disease may require a reduced dose to prevent accumulation in the body. The medication should be used with caution in these cases and under strict veterinary supervision.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Do not use if the pet has a known allergy to cephalexin, other cephalosporins, or penicillins, as cross-reactions are possible and can be serious. Do not use Cephavet in rabbits, gerbils, guinea pigs, and hamsters.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> The most common side effects are vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. If these symptoms become severe or persistent, discontinue treatment and consult a veterinarian. Giving the medication with food can help reduce stomach upset.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Cephavet's efficacy can be reduced by concomitant administration of bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g., macrolides, sulphonamides, tetracyclines). Nephrotoxicity risk is increased if combined with certain polypeptide antibiotics, aminoglycosides, and some diuretics like furosemide, so this combination should generally be avoided.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Give the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not give two doses at one time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek your veterinarian for emergency medical attention.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
<br>
<br> Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep out of reach of the children and pets.
