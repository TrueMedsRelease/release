    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Apcalis SX is a jelly solution for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction. Apcalis SX increases blood flow to the penis allowing more blood flow into the penis like happened naturally when a man is sexually stimulated. With more blood flowing in and less flowing out, the arteries in the penis enlarge resulting erection.

    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>For most patients, Apcalis SX should be taken once a day as needed. In patients taking certain protease inhibitors (such as for the treatment of HIV), it is recommended to not exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg of Apcalis SX in a 48-hour period.
    <br>If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. Do not take 2 doses at once.
    <br>In most cases the dosage should not increase more than once in a day (24 hours).
    <br>For people who consume protease inhibitors (used in treatment of HIV), the dosage should not be more than a single dose of 25 mg of Apcalis SX within 48 hours.
    <br>If you miss out on a dose, then take it as soon as you remember about it. But keep in mind that you will have to adjust your next dose by spacing it out by 4 to 5 hours. If this is not possible, then the best thing to do would be to skip the missed dose and continue with your normal dosage schedule.
    <br>Never try to compensate for the missed dose by taking a double dose together. It may cause adverse effects.

    <strong>Safety information</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Drinking alcohol can temporarily impair the ability to get an erection. To get the maximum benefit from your medication, you are advised not to drink large amounts of alcohol before taking Apcalis SX.
    <br>Before you start any treatment with Apcalis SX, be sure to ask your healthcare provider if your heart is healthy enough.
    <br>If you're a man who uses nitrate drugs, like nitroglycerine, never take Apcalis SX. The combination of Apcalis SX and nitrates can make your blood pressure suddenly drop to unsafe levels. You could get dizzy, faint, or even have a heart attack or stroke. Nitrates are found in many prescription medications that are used to treat angina (chest pain due to heart disease).
    <br>If you are not sure, whether any of your medications contain nitrates, or if you do not understand what nitrates are, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
    <br>Discuss your past/current medical history in detail with your doctor before beginning treatment with any new medication. Ask your doctor if your heart is healthy enough before starting with this medication.
    <br>Doctors advise against using Apcalis SX if you are allergic to any ingredient in it or if you use nitrate drugs, like nitroglycerine. The combined effect of Apcalis SX and nitrates can make your blood pressure suddenly drop. It can also make you dizzy, faint, or even have a heart attack or stroke.
