<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Prasugrel is used in people who've had a balloon angioplasty to open blocked arteries after having a heart attack or severe chest pain. Prasugrel may help lower your risk of having another heart attack or stroke.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use the medicine exactly as directed. If you also take aspirin, follow your doctor's instructions about how much to take and for how long. Prasugrel can be taken with or without food. Swallow the tablet whole and do not crush, chew, or break it.
<br> Do not stop using prasugrel without your doctor's advice, even if you feel fine. Stopping this medicine too soon may increase your risk of a blood clot, heart attack, or death.
<br>
<br>
