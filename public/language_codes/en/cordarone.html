<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Cordarone belongs to the antiarrhythmics. It is used to correct abnormal rhythms of the heart, to treat potentially life-threatening types of abnormal heart rhythms (such as persistent ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia). It helps by making the heart beat more regularly and it works by blocking certain electrical signals in the heart that can cause an irregular heartbeat. The effects of this medication may be noted as early as three days after starting treatment, but it is usually one to three weeks before beneficial effects are seen.
