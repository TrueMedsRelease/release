<br>
<br> Empagliflozin is used together with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in adults and children at least 10 years old with type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin is also used to lower the risk of death from heart attack, stroke, or heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes who also have heart disease. Empagliflozin is also used in adults to lower the risk of dying or needing to be in a hospital for heart failure when the heart cannot pump blood properly. Empagliflozin is not for treating type 1 diabetes.
