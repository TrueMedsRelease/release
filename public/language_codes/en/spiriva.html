<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Spiriva is a bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways and increases air flow to the lungs. Spiriva is used to prevent bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways in the lungs) in adults with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), including bronchitis and emphysema. Spiriva Respimat is also used to prevent asthma attacks in adults and children who are at least 6 years old.
