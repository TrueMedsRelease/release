<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Melalite Forte Cream is a topical medication primarily used to manage hyperpigmentation, a condition that results in dark patches on the skin. It is part of a group of medicines called skin-lightening agents. In addition to managing hyperpigmentation, it is also used for melasma, freckles, and age spots. These are all conditions that cause uneven skin tone and discoloration, making the skin lose its natural complexion.
