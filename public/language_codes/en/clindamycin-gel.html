<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Clindamycin Gel is primarily used for managing acne vulgaris, a prevalent skin condition. This medicine belongs to the class of topical antibiotics, known for their effectiveness in controlling bacterial growth on the skin. Apart from its primary use against acne, this medicine has also shown positive results in reducing inflammation caused by bacterial proliferation. The bacteria, named Propionibacterium acnes, are often responsible for inflamed hair follicles leading to acne.
