<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Loxitane is an antipsychotic medication that is used to treat schizophrenia.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed. You may not start feeling better right away when you start taking Loxitane. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse while using this medicine.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Tell your doctor if you have ever had: epilepsy or other seizure disorder; low white blood cell (WBC) counts; glaucoma; urination problems; blockage in your digestive tract (stomach or intestines); Parkinson's disease; heart disease; or breast cancer.
<br> Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or you get pregnant. Using antipsychotic medication during the last 3 months of pregnancy may cause breathing problems, feeding problems, or withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.
<br> Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Loxitane will affect you. Avoid getting up too fast from a sitting or lying position, or you may feel dizzy.
