    <strong>Drug interactions</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Prilosec can decreases elimination of diazepam, warfarin and phenytoin. These are medications metabolized in the liver by oxidation. Drugs which are metabolized with help of cytochrome P-450 system (e.g. cyclosporine, disulfiram, benzodiazepines) may also interact with Prilosec because it is metabolized the same way. Clarithromycin is also metabolized by cytochrome P450, concomitant administration of clarithromycin with Prilosec may result in increases in plasma levels of Prilosec. Concomitant use of Prilosec and clarithromycin may result in increases in plasma levels of erithromycin, and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin. You may need additional monitoring of your condition if you are taking ampicillin, cilostazol, cyclosporine, diazepam, digoxin, disulfiram, iron, itraconazole, ketoconazole, moclobemide, phenytoin, sucralfate, vorconizole, or warfarin. This medicine may be combined with antacids if they were prescribed by your doctor. Potent acid-reducing drugs such as Prilosec diminish the effectiveness of sucralfate, and other medicaitons such as the antifungals ketoconazole and itraconazole. If instructed to take any of these medicines while taking Prilosec, consult your doctor or pharmacist regarding the proper timing of each dose, usually Prilosec is taken 30 minutes before sucralfate.
