<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Zytanix tablets is used to treat fluid retention (edema) caused by heart failure, kidney disease, or liver conditions, and also to manage high blood pressure. It contains metolazone, a diuretic that boosts the kidneysâ€™ removal of salt and water, reducing swelling and lowering blood pressure. This medicine can also be employed in managing high blood pressure, thereby reducing the risk of heart disease and strokes. It is beneficial in conditions where the body retains more water than it needs, such as in liver cirrhosis and some kidney disorders.
