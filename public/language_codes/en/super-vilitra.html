<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Super Vilitra is a combination of two drugs Vardenafil and Dapoxetine into one and is used as a treatment for two conditions: erectile dysfunctions (impotence) and premature ejaculation. Vardenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5 inhibitor) while Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Super Vilitra tablets are to be used if and when you want to have sexual intercourse with your partner. Only one dosage is to be taken in 24 hours, if you want another dosage, please wait for at least 24 hours. You have to gulp down the whole tablet with water, without chewing or breaking it. You can eat food along with it, but do not consume very fatty meals along with this medication because it will delay the onset period of this medication. This oral erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation treatment starts to kick in your system within 30 minutes to 1 hour and stays effective for 5 to 6 hours. Please do not exceed or alter the prescribed dosage to prevent the risk of overdose.
