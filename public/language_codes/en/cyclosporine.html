<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Cyclosporine is used to prevent organ rejection after a kidney, heart, or liver transplant. Cyclosporine weakens your body's immune system, to help keep it from "rejecting" a transplanted organ such as a kidney. Organ rejection happens when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it. Cyclosporine is also used to treat severe psoriasis or severe rheumatoid arthritis.
