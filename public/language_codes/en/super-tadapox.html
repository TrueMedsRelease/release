<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Super Tadapox tablets is a combination of two medicines: Tadalafil and Dapoxetine, which treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) and Premature Ejaculation (PE). Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor which works by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation and enables its erection following sexual stimulation. Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) which increases the level of serotonin in nerves to improve control over ejaculation and increase the time taken to ejaculate.
