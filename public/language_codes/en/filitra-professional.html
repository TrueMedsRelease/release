<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Filitra Professional (Vardenafil) is used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence; inability to get or keep an erection) in men. Filitra Professional works by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation. Vardenafil relaxes muscles found in the walls of blood vessels and increases blood flow to particular areas of the body. This increased blood flow can cause an erection.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> The recommended dose of Filitra Professional is 20 mg per day taken an hour before intercourse. Do not take more than one tab of Filitra Professional a day.
<br>
