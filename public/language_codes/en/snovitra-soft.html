<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Snovitra Soft is a chewable tablet designed to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. It contains Vardenafil, a potent phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor that enhances blood flow to the penis, facilitating a firm and lasting erection during sexual arousal. The soft chewable form allows for quicker absorption compared to standard tablets, making it a convenient option for those who prefer not to swallow pills.
