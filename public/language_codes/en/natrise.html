<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Natrise tablet is used to treat low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia) associated with conditions like heart failure, cirrhosis, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). It works by blocking the hormone vasopressin, which helps the kidneys retain water, thereby increasing blood sodium levels. This medicine is particularly useful for individuals with conditions like heart failure, liver disease (cirrhosis), and hormonal imbalances such as the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). By regulating sodium levels, Natrise Tablet improves overall health and helps prevent potential complications associated with low sodium.
