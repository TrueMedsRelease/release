<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Clomid (Clomiphene) is a medication that increases your chances of pregnancy by helping your body produce an egg (ovulation). Ovulation is a phase in your menstrual cycle where your ovary releases an egg. This medication treats irregular or absent ovulation among people trying to get pregnant.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take this medication by mouth with a glass of water. Follow the directions on the prescription label. Take exactly as directed for the exact number of days prescribed. Take your doses at regular intervals. Most women take this medication for a 5-day period, but the length of treatment may be adjusted. Your care team will give you a start date for this medication and will give you instructions on proper use. Do not take your medication more often than directed.

<strong>Precautions</strong>
