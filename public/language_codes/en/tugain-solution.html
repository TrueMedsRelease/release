<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Tugain Solution is primarily used to manage hair loss, specifically a condition known as androgenetic alopecia. This topical medicine belongs to a class of drugs known as vasodilators. In addition to addressing hair loss, this solution is also beneficial in promoting hair regrowth. It is particularly efficient in individuals experiencing pattern baldness, an issue characterized by gradual thinning or bald patches on the top of the scalp.
