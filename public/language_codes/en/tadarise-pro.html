<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Tadarise Pro (Tadalafil) is a new product used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. During sexual stimulation, Tadarise Pro (Tadalafil) enables a man's penis to fill with enough blood to cause an erection. It does this by blocking an enzyme called phosphodiesterase-5, or PDE-5. This helps the smooth muscles in the penis relax and widen, which allows for more blood to enter.

<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Swallow one 20mg tablet with a glass of water approximately one hour before sexual intercourse. In Tadarise Pro (Tadalafil) clinical testing most men were administered one 20 mg Tadarise Pro (Tadalafil) tablet per day. Your doctor will prescribe the right dosage for you.
