<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Elidel is an immunosuppressant. It works by decreasing your body's immune system to help slow down the growth of atopic dermatitis (eczema) on your skin. Elidel cream is a prescription medicine used on the skin for treatment of mild to moderate eczema (atopic dermatitis) in adults and children at least 2 years old.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use Elidel exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take Elidel by mouth. Topical medicine is for use only on the skin.
<br> Wash your hands before and after applying Elidel cream, unless you are treating eczema on your hands. If you are applying the medicine to another person, wash your hands with soap and water afterward. Apply a thin layer of Elidel cream to clean, dry skin and rub in gently. Use the smallest amount needed to control the symptoms of eczema. Use Elidel only on skin that is affected by eczema.

<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> To make sure Elidel is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: skin cancer; a bacterial or viral skin infection (including herpes or chickenpox); Netherton's syndrome (a genetic skin disorder); or a weak immune system (caused by disease or by using certain medicine).
<br> Elidel can lower the blood cells that help your body fight infections. This can make it easier for you to get sick from a virus. Tell your doctor if you have been exposed to any illness, or if you have any signs of infection such as fever, chills, sore throat, or flu symptoms.
