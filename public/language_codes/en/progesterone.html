<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Progesterone is used to cause menstrual periods in women who have not yet reached menopause but are not having periods due to a lack of progesterone in the body. It is also used to prevent overgrowth in the lining of the uterus in postmenopausal women who are receiving estrogen hormone replacement therapy.
<br> Progesterone is a naturally occurring hormone important for the regulation of ovulation and menstruation. Progesterone is produced in high amounts in females by the ovaries. It is also produced in smaller amounts by the adrenal glands both males and females.
