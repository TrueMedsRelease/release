<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Xyzal is an antihistamine that reduces the effects of natural chemical histamine in the body. Histamine can produce symptoms such as a runny nose or hives. Xyzal is used to treat symptoms of year-round (perennial) allergies in children who are at least 6 months old. Xyzal is also used to treat itching and swelling caused by chronic urticaria (hives) in adults and children who are at least 6 months old.
