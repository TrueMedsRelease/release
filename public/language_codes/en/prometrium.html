<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Prometrium is a female hormone important for the regulation of ovulation and menstruation. Prometrium is used to cause menstrual periods in women who have not yet reached menopause but are not having periods due to a lack of progesterone in the body. This medicine is also used to prevent overgrowth in the lining of the uterus in postmenopausal women who are receiving estrogen hormone replacement therapy.
