<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Victoza is a prescription medication used to treat adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This helps to avoid catastrophic diabetes consequences such as kidney damage and blindness. Diabetes under control also helps to reduce your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.
<br> Victoza is a diabetes medication in the GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide) class. It works by helping the body's production of insulin and suppressing appetite. Additionally, it aids in weight loss in some individuals. Refrigerate this medication until needed, but do not freeze it.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> It is typically injected once daily under the skin. The dose will be determined by your medical condition and the additional diabetic medications you are already taking. You can use it at any time of day, with or without food, but it is most beneficial if you use it at the same time each day. Your doctor or nurse will demonstrate how to inject the medication and where to inject it. Take care to follow the directions.

<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Consumption of alcohol while using Victoza is not recommended.
<br> Victoza may be dangerous to use during pregnancy. Although human research is sparse, animal studies have demonstrated negative effects on the growing fetus. Before prescribing it to you, your doctor will balance the benefits and possible hazards. Consult your physician.
<br> Victoza is most likely dangerous to use while nursing. Human evidence suggests that the medication may enter into breastmilk and cause harm to the infant.
<br> Generally, Victoza does not affect your ability to drive. Patients should be warned, however, to take precautions to avoid hypoglycemia while driving or using machinery, particularly when combined with a sulfonylurea or insulin.
<br> Victoza is safe to administer to people with kidney dysfunction. No dose change is indicated for Victoza.
