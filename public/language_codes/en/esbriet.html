<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Esbriet (pirfenidone) may be used to treat adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lung condition that causes inflammation and scarring in the lungs. Esbriet’s mechanism of action involves slowing down the build-up of scar tissue in the lungs. Esbriet is not a cure for IPF, but it does slow how quickly the condition progresses.
