<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Parlodel is a stimulator of the central and peripheral D2-dopamine receptors (a derivative of ergot alkaloids). It inhibits a secretion of prolactin, suppresses the physiological lactation, promotes normalization of periods, inhibits an excessive secretion of growth hormone, reduces size and number of cysts in the breast (normalizing the imbalance between progesterone and estrogen). Its high doses stimulate dopamine receptors in the striatum, the substantia nigra in brain, hypothalamus and mesolimbic system. Parlodel is used to treat infertility in some women, abnormal stoppage or absence of flow in periods, growth hormone overproduction leading to acromegaly, Parkinson's disease, pituitary gland tumors.
