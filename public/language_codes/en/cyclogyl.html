<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Cyclogyl relaxes muscles in your eye to dilate (widen) your pupil. Cyclogyl (for the eyes) is used to dilate your pupil in preparation for an eye exam.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> This medicine is usually given about 40 to 50 minutes before your eye exam or other procedure. After you receive the drops, close your eyes for 2 or 3 minutes with your head tipped down, without blinking or squinting. Gently press your finger to the inside corner of the eye to keep the liquid from draining into your tear duct.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Cyclogyl can cause feeding problems in an infant. After this medicine has been given to your infant, wait at least 4 hours before you feed the child.
<br> Cyclogyl can cause blurred vision for up to 24 hours after using it. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be able to see clearly.
<br> Cyclogyl may also make your eyes more sensitive to light. Until the effects wear off, protect your eyes from the sun or bright light.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> It is not likely that other drugs you take orally or inject will have an effect on cyclopentolate used in the eyes. But many drugs can interact with each other. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all medicines you use, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.
<br>

<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek emergency medical attention.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
