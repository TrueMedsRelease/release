<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Modalert is a medicine that helps manage daytime sleeping issues and improves wakefulness. It is used to reduce extreme sleepiness and increase alertness during the day. This medicine is often prescribed for conditions such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to control sleep-wake cycles. People with narcolepsy may feel rested after waking, but then feel very sleepy throughout much of the day.
