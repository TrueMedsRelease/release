<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Donamem is used to manage Alzheimer's disease by improving brain function and helping with memory loss. It contains two active ingredients: Donepezil and Memantine. Donepezil increases levels of the chemical acetylcholine, while Memantine regulates the activity of glutamate. These components work together to balance chemicals in the brain and support nerve signals. This medication helps slow down the progression of Alzheimer's symptoms and supports overall brain health.
