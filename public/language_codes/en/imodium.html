<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Imodium is an antidiarrheal medication. It binds opioid receptors in the wall of intestine, inhibits release of acetylcholine and prostaglandins hereby reducing peristalsis, increases time needed for the food to pass through intestines. Imodium increases tone of the anal sphincter, reducing stool incontinence and urge to defecate. Imodium is used to treat diarrhea, to reduce the amount of stool in patients with ileostomy (re-routing of the bowel is brought out by a surgical opening through in the stomach).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> The drug is administered for oral intake. To treat acute diarrhea in adults and elderly patients a prescribed initial dose is 4 mg, decreased to 2 mg in the future after each act of defecation in the case of loose stool. Initial dose of 2 mg is recommended for children older than 6 y.o. Tablets of Imodium are rather fragile so do not press them through the foil. Do not take Imodium more than 3 times in 24 hours.
