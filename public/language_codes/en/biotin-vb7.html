<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Biotin VB7 tablets are primarily used to treat and prevent Vitamin B7 deficiency, promoting healthier hair, skin, and nails by boosting keratin production. They are commonly prescribed to reduce hair fall, strengthen brittle nails, and improve skin texture. These tablets also assist in metabolic processes, converting food into energy.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Typically, one tablet is taken daily after a meal, but it should be used as prescribed by a doctor. Swallow the tablet whole; do not crush, chew, or break it. Taking the supplement at the same time each day may help maintain consistent levels, though individual needs vary.
