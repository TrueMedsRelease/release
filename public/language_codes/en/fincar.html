This condition, characterized by an enlarged prostate, is managed with this medicine which belongs to a group of medications known as 5Î±-reductase inhibitors. In addition to managing BPH, this medicine also aids in reducing the risk of acute urinary retention and decreases the need for surgery related to prostate enlargement. It works by mitigating symptoms such as difficulty or frequent urination by controlling the size of the prostate.
