<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Lyrica was originally approved as an anti-epileptic drug, also called an anticonvulsant. It works by slowing down impulses in the brain that cause seizures. Pregabalin also affects chemicals in the brain that send pain signals across the nervous system. Lyrica is used to treat pain caused by fibromyalgia, or nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), herpes zoster (post-herpetic neuralgia), or spinal cord injury.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Lyrica exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Take the medicine at the same time each day, with or without food. Do not crush, chew, or break an extended-release tablet. Swallow the tablet whole. Do not stop using Lyrica suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may cause increased seizures or unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose for at least 1 week before stopping completely.

<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Avoid drinking alcohol. It may increase certain side effects of Lyrica.
<br> Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how this medicine will affect you. Your reactions could be impaired.
<br> To make sure Lyrica is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); a mood disorder, depression, or suicidal thoughts; heart problems (especially congestive heart failure); a bleeding disorder, or low levels of platelets in your blood; kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis); diabetes (unless you are taking pregabalin to treat diabetic neuropathy); drug or alcohol addiction; or a severe allergic reaction (angioedema).

<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not use Lyrica if you are allergic to pregabalin.
<br> Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice. Pregabalin is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old to treat nerve pain caused by fibromyalgia, diabetes, herpes zoster, or spinal cord injury.
<br> If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of pregabalin on the baby. You should not breastfeed while using pregabalin.
<br> Pregabalin can temporarily decrease sperm count and may affect fertility in men (your ability to have children). Ask your doctor about your risk.
