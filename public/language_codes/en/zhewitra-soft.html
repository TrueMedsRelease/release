<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Zhewitra Soft tablets are prescribed to treat male erectile dysfunction. They contain vardenafil, which helps to get and sustain erections during sexual activity by improving blood flow to the penis. The mechanism of action of Zhewitra Soft tablets (generic vardenafil) is the inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5), an enzyme that raises cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in the penis. This results in increased blood flow and relaxed muscles, which help to facilitate erections during sexual stimulation.
