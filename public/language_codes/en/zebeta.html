<p><strong>Common use<br></strong><br>Zebeta contains active ingredient Bisoprolol Fumarate and belongs to a class of drugs called beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. Mechanism of its action is to prevent the chemicals transmitting nervous signal between nerves such as norepinephrine and adrenaline to bind receptors on nerves. This way heart rate and blood pressure are reduced as force of heart contractions and tone of blood vessels diminish.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Take exactly when it is prescribed by your doctor, do not change your dose and stop taking the rug suddenly as it may affect your self-condition. <br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> This medication influences ability&nbsp; of attention concentration, so be specially careful if you need to drive or do work which requires fast reaction.
