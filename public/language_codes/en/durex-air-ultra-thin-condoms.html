<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Durex Air Ultra Thin Condoms are used for providing protection against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). They are made with natural rubber latex and designed to provide greater sensitivity during sexual intercourse. These condoms are electronically tested for any imperfections.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Put on the condom before engaging in sexual intercourse. The role of the condom should be on the outside. The end of the condom must be squeezed before putting it on to release any air trapped inside. While squeezing the end with one hand, one should put the condom on top of the genital and roll it with the other. Once ejaculation is reached and while the genital is still erect, hold the condom firmly and take it off carefully.

<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> This product is for single-use only. Seek medical assistance as soon as possible, at least within 72 hrs, if the condom leaks/ bursts during use.
<br> Condoms significantly reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancies and STIs but do not guarantee 100% protection.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Don't use these condoms if you or your partner are allergic to latex. Condoms made of polyurethane or polyisoprene are two latex-free options you might want to use.
<br> Don’t use oil-based lubes and medications with latex condoms.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Durex Air Ultra Thin Condoms are generally safe, but potential side effects include mild irritation, genital discomfort, or allergic reactions to the natural rubber latex, such as rashes. Due to their ultra-thin nature, some users may experience a higher risk of breakage or tearing compared to standard condoms.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> For added comfort, you can use silicone or water-based lubricants; however, stay away from oil-based products since they may cause damage to the latex.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
<br>
<br> Store the condoms in a cool and dry place. Protect from heat and direct sunlight. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets. Do not use a condom after the expiry date (indicated on each pack).
