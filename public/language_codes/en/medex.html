<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Medex (Coumadin) is an anticoagulant (blood thinner). Medex reduces the formation of blood clots. Medex is used to treat or prevent blood clots in veins or arteries, which can reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other serious conditions.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Medex exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Take this medicine at the same time every day, with or without food. Never take a double dose.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Medex can make it easier for you to bleed. Seek emergency help if you have any bleeding that will not stop.
<br> You may need to stop taking Medex 5 to 7 days before having any surgery, dental work, or a medical procedure. Call your doctor for instructions.
<br> To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: diabetes; congestive heart failure; liver disease, kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis); a hereditary clotting deficiency; or low blood platelets after receiving heparin.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not take Medex if you are allergic to warfarin, or if: you have malignant hypertension, which is a specific type of very high blood pressure that comes on suddenly and quickly; you recently had or will have surgery on your brain, spine, or eye; you undergo a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia (epidural); or if you think you will not be able to take Medex on time every day, talk to your prescriber about other treatment options.
<br> You also should not take Medex if you are are prone to bleeding because of a medical condition, such as: a blood cell disorder (such as low red blood cells or low platelets); ulcers or bleeding in your stomach, intestines, lungs, or urinary tract; an aneurysm or bleeding in the brain; or an infection of the lining of your heart.
<br> Do not take Medex if you are pregnant, unless your doctor tells you to.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Medex: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
<br> Medex increases your risk of bleeding, which can be severe or life-threatening. Call your doctor at once if you have any signs of bleeding such as: sudden headache, feeling very weak or dizzy; swelling, pain, unusual bruising; bleeding gums, nosebleeds; bleeding from wounds or needle injections that will not stop; heavy menstrual periods or abnormal vaginal bleeding; blood in your urine, bloody or tarry stools; or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.
<br> Clots formed by Medex may block normal blood flow, which could lead to tissue death or amputation of the affected body part. Get medical help at once if you have: pain, swelling, hot or cold feeling, skin changes, or discoloration anywhere on your body; or sudden and severe leg or foot pain, foot ulcer, purple toes or fingers.
<br> Bleeding is the most common side effect of Medex (Coumadin).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Many drugs (including some over-the-counter medicines and herbal products) can affect your INR and may increase the risk of bleeding if you take them with Medex (Coumadin). It is very important to ask your doctor and pharmacist before you start or stop using any other medicine, especially: other medicines to prevent blood clots; an antibiotic or antifungal medicine; supplements that contain vitamin K; or herbal (botanical) products - coenzyme Q10, cranberry, echinacea, garlic, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, goldenseal, or St. John's wort.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek emergency medical attention. An overdose can cause excessive bleeding.
<br>
<br>
