<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Albuterol inhaler is a bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways and increases air flow to the lungs. Albuterol inhalation is used to treat or prevent bronchospasm, or narrowing of the airways in the lungs, in people with asthma or certain types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use albuterol inhalation exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use albuterol inhalation in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. The usual dose of albuterol inhalation is 2 inhalations every 4 to 6 hours. To prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm, use 2 inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before you exercise. The effects of albuterol inhalation should last about 4 to 6 hours.
