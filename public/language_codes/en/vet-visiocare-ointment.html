<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Visiocare Ointment (Cyclosporine) treats immune-mediated eye conditions in dogs and cats, primarily Dry Eye (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca - KCS) and Chronic Superficial Keratitis (CSK), by stimulating tear production, reducing inflammation, and preventing scarring or vision loss. This veterinary medicine helps restore natural tear film, easing discomfort from inadequate moisture and chronic irritation, and is applied directly to the eye as directed by a vet.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> To use Visiocare Ointment, gently restrain your pet, tilt their head back, pull down the lower eyelid to create a small pocket, and squeeze a 1/4-inch (0.6 centimeters) strip of ointment into it, avoiding touching the eye with the tube tip; let the pet blink to spread it, then reward them, applying twice daily as directed by your vet.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Use with caution or avoid if the pet has corneal ulcers, as the ointment may delay healing. Use with caution in pregnant or lactating animals. If the pet is on other eye medications, wait 10-15 minutes between applications.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> It should not be used in cases of viral or fungal eye infections, as it may worsen or prolong these conditions. Do not use in pets allergic to cyclosporine.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Commonly reported side effects include mild irritation, burning, stinging, redness of the eyes, and eyelid spasms. More serious side effects, such as allergic reactions (swelling of the throat, difficulty breathing), should be reported to a veterinarian immediately.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> While topical cyclosporine is generally considered safe and has few known direct drug interactions compared to oral, it should be used with caution when combined with specific, other, or potent therapies. If using other eye drops or ointments, wait at least 10–15 minutes between applying Visiocare Ointment and other treatments to avoid interactions and ensure proper absorption. Generally, eye drops should be applied before eye ointments.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Give the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not give two doses at one time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek your veterinarian for emergency medical attention.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
<br>
<br> Store below 30 C (or 25 C depending on packaging), do not freeze, and protect from light. Keep out of reach of the children and pets.
