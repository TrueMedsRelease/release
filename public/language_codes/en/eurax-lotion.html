<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Eurax is an anti-parasite medicine that kills certain parasites that live or lay eggs in your skin. Eurax (for the skin) is used to treat scabies and to reduce itching associated with certain skin conditions.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Do not take by mouth. Eurax is for use only on the skin. Do not use this medicine on swollen or oozing skin. If this medicine gets in your eyes or mouth, rinse with water. Shake the lotion well just before each use.
<br> To treat itching: Massage Eurax into the affected areas until it is completely absorbed. Repeat as needed.
<br> To treat scabies: Take a bath or shower and dry your skin thoroughly before applying Eurax. Apply a thin layer of the cream or lotion to all body parts from the neck down to the soles of your feet (scabies does not usually infect the head). Be sure the medicine gets into all the folds of your skin, between your toes and fingers, and underneath your nails. Scabies are likely to stay under the nails if the area is not treated. Keep the nails trimmed short. Leave the medicine on for 24 hours. Then apply a second dose without washing your skin first. Thoroughly wash off the medicine 48 hours after the last application.
