<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Xylocaine is primarily used for local anesthesia, to numb tissues in specific areas. This medicine falls into the category of local anaesthetics, which are commonly applied to numb specific body parts before medical procedures. In addition to its main use, this gel also offers relief from pain, irritation, and itching associated with minor skin conditions, abrasions, and insect bites. It further reduces discomfort during medical procedures involving tubes inserted into the mouth, throat, nose, or urinary tract and acts as a lubricant for endotracheal intubation and catheterization.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Always ensure the area of application is clean before applying the gel. Apply a thin layer of the gel to the affected area gently massaging it in, not more than 3-4 times daily. Avoid contact with your eyes, nose, and mouth. After applying the gel, remember to wash your hands unless you're treating them.

<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Liver disease: If you have liver problems, your body's ability to break down lignocaine might be reduced. This can lead to higher levels of the medication in your blood.
<br> Kidney disease: Lidocaine is excreted by the kidneys. So, if you have kidney disease, it could potentially prolong the action of lidocaine.
<br>
<br>
