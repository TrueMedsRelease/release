<p><strong>Product Description<br></strong><br><strong> Common use<br></strong><br> Ventolin is a selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Its therapeutic doses interact with β2-adrenergic receptors in muscles of the bronchi. After inhalation of 10-20% of the administered dose reaches the lower respiratory tract. The medication starts to act 4-5 minutes after inhalation and does for 4-6 hours. Ventolin is used to relieve symptoms of asthma, to treat patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Do not use the medication more frequently than recommended. Common initial dose for inhalation is 2.5 mg, which could be increased up to 5 mg later. The solution for inhalations must be protected from microbial contamination which could spread to the patient's mucous. Use proper aseptic techniques each time you open the bottle. Avoid any contact of the dropper tip of the bottle with any surface. Do not use the solution if it changes color or becomes cloudy.<br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> If you noticed that the medication does not help or your symptoms worsened you should check up with your doctor. Intake of other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be done only by recommendations of your doctor. Inform your doctor about all allergic reactions you had in history and also about diabetes, heart or blood vessel disease, heart rhythm problems, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, seizure disorders. <br><br> <strong>Contraindications<br></strong><br> Hypersensitivity to the medication or its components in history.<br><br> <strong>Possible side effects<br></strong><br> The most common side effects are: shakiness in the legs, arms, hands, or feet, trembling or shaking of the hands or feet. More rare side effects include fast, irregular, pounding, or racing heartbeat or pulse palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, and tremor or nervousness. <br><br> <strong>Drug interactions<br></strong><br> Ventolin cannot be co-administered with other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or used with cautiousness to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects. Simultaneous use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants is contraindicated. Their intake should be administered 2 weeks later after treatment with Ventolin is finished. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents are able to produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma and interact block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists (Ventolin). Beta-agonists worsen hypokalemia caused by nonpotassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics). Ventolin decreases serum levels of digoxin. <br><br> <strong>Missed dose<br></strong><br> If you forgot to take your dose in time, please do it as soon as you remember.

Take your doses at about the same time each day to avoid missing a dose.<br><br> <strong>Overdose<br></strong><br> Transitory changes induced by β2-adrenergic receptor agonists such as tachicardia, tremor, headache are symptoms of overdose. Severe hypopotassemia appears as result of Ventolin overdose.<br><br> <strong>Storage<br></strong><br> Store at room temperature away from moisture, sunlight, kids and pets in a tight container.<br><br> <strong>Disclaimer<br></strong><br> We provide only general information about medications which does not cover all directions, possible drug integrations, or precautions.
