<br> Lymph nodes may sometimes painfully swell up.
<br> Level of glucose may rise also so it should be used cautiously in patients with diabetes.

<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Dilantin increases effects of coumarin anticoagulant drugs, while the anticoagulants in their turn increase blood levels of Dilantin which may aggravate risk of toxicity and hemorrhagic complications. Inform your doctor if you are taking digoxin, carbamazepine, clonazepam, corticosteroids (prednisone), cyclosporine, disopyramide, doxycycline, estrogens, felodipine, levodopa, lidocaine, methadone, mexiletine, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, tacrolimus, theophylline, phenobarbital, and warfarin as they may decrease blood levels of Dilantin.
<br>
<br> Tricyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), Desipramine (Norpramin, Pertofrane), Amoxapine (Asendin), Clomipramine (Anafranil), Imipramine (Tofranil), Nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl), Doxepin (Adapin, Sinequan), Protriptyline (Vivactil), Trimipramine (Surmontil) in large doses diminish a convulsive threshold and in small doses increase it, some of them are able to slow down metabolism of Dilantin and increase its toxicity hereby. Isonicotinic acid, certain antibiotics (levomitsetin), sulfonamides, aminasine are able to increase toxicity of Dilantin.
<br>
<br> Dilantin increases hypotention effects of diuretics and other anti-hypertension medications, strengthens action of anapryline and antiarrhythmic medications, thyroid hormone replacement drugs. Dilantin decreases activity of medications for diabetes, affects metabolism of corticosteroids and tetracycline (Vibramycin), influences absorption of diuretics (Furocemide). Dilantin may increase indices of bilirubin, cholesterol, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, liver transaminases in blood tests.

<br> High concentration of Dilantin (more than 50 mg/l) in rare cases may cause aggravation of attacks, sopor (abnormally deep sleep) and coma.
<br> Large doses of the medication increase blood levels of glucose in patients who are not sick with diabetes.
<br> Blood levels of Dilantin over 20 mg/l in children may lead to acute toxicity: nystagmus, ataxia, mental disorders, joint pain, and in more severe cases bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrial flutter, asystole, and coma.
