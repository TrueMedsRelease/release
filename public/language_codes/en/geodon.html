<br> Geodon is used to treat schizophrenia and the manic episodes of bipolar disorder. It possesses high affinity to dopamine D2-receptors and more significant affinity to serotonin 5-HT2A-receptors. It is supposed that the medication blocks serotonin and dopamine receptors and inhibits the re-uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain and this way shows its anti-psychotic activity. Geodon is used to treat psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, and affective disorders.
