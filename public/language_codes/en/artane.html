    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Take trihexyphenidyl exactly as directed by your doctor. If you do not understand these directions, ask your pharmacist, nurse, or doctor to explain them to you.
    <br>Take each dose with a full glass of water. Trihexyphenidyl may be taken with or without meals. Taking trihexyphenidyl with food may lessen stomach upset.
    <br>Before taking trihexyphenidyl, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or if you have any other allergies. This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.
    <br>This medication should not be used if you have certain medical conditions. Before using this medicine, consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have: certain eye problem (narrow-angle glaucoma), blockage of the bladder/esophagus/stomach/intestines (e.g., bowel obstruction), severe ulcerative colitis.
    <br>Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: alcohol use, breathing problems (e.g., asthma, emphysema), diarrhea caused by an infection, certain eye problem.
    <br>To ensure that you get a correct dose, measure the liquid form of trihexyphenidyl with a special dose-measuring spoon or cup, not with a regular table spoon.
    <br>If you miss a dose take the missed dose as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and only take the next regularly scheduled dose. Do not take a double dose of this medication.
    <br>Dosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl HCl) may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water.
    <br>Abrupt withdrawal of treatment for parkinsonism may result in acute exacerbation of parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided.
    <br>Abrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

    <strong>Safety information</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Patients with cardiac, liver, or kidney disorders, or with hypertension, should be closely monitored.
    <br>Since ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) has atropine-like properties, patients on long-term treatment should be carefully monitored for untoward reactions.
    <br>Since ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) has parasympatholytic activity, it should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma, obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts, and in elderly males with possible prostatic hypertrophy. Incipient glaucoma may be precipitated by parasympatholytic drugs such as ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl).
    <br>Do not use Artane without first talking to your doctor if you have:
    <br>ever had an allergic reaction to it;
    <br>narrow-angle glaucoma;
    <br>an obstruction in the bowel or a complication of bowel disease known as megacolon; or
    <br>myasthenia gravis. 
    <br>Before taking this medication, tell your doctor if you have:
    <br>enlargement of the prostate or difficulty urinating;
    <br>epilepsy or another seizure disorder;
    <br>heart disease or an irregular heartbeat;
    <br>depression or any other psychiatric illness;
    <br>kidney disease; or
    <br>liver disease. 
    <br>You may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you have any of the conditions listed above.
    <br>It is not known whether trihexyphenidyl will be harmful to an unborn baby. Do not take this medication without first talking to your doctor if you are pregnant or could become pregnant during treatment. It is not known whether trihexyphenidyl passes into breast milk. Do not take this medication without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.

    <strong>Possible side effects</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Minor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with ARTANE (trihexyphenidyl) than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses.
    <br>If you experience any of the following serious side effects, stop taking trihexyphenidyl and seek emergency medical attention or contact your doctor immediately:
    <br>an allergic reaction (difficulty breathing; closing of the throat; swelling of the lips, tongue, or face; or hives);
    <br>fever;
    <br>fast or irregular heartbeats;
    <br>anxiety, hallucinations, confusion, agitation, hyperactivity, or loss of consciousness;
    <br>seizures;
    <br>eye pain; or
    <br>a rash. 
    <br>Other, less serious side effects may be more likely to occur. Continue to take trihexyphenidyl and talk to your doctor if you experience:
    <br>dryness of the mouth;
    <br>large pupils or blurred vision;
    <br>drowsiness or dizziness;
    <br>difficulty urinating or constipation;
    <br>nervousness or anxiety;
    <br>upset stomach; or
    <br>decreased sweating.
    <br>This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.
