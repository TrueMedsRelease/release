<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Duphaston contains dydrogesterone, a synthetic hormone similar to progesterone. The medication is used to restore the hormone balance when synthesis of progesterone in the body is not sufficient (sterility, abortion, premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation, secondary amenorrhea, dysfunctional uterine bleeding). The medication stimulates beginning of the secretory phase in the endometrium thereby reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinogenesis, which increases due to estrogen.
