<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Namenda is used to treat moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Namenda's mechanism of action is to help balance a brain chemical called glutamate. In Alzheimer's, there can be too much glutamate activity, which can harm brain cells. By controlling glutamate, Namenda may help protect brain cells from damage and improve memory and thinking skills in some people with Alzheimer's.
