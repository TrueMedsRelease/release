<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>

By blocking the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), it helps increase hair growth and prevents further hair loss in men. Specifically, it is most effective in the vertex and midscalp areas of the scalp. In addition to its use in hair restoration, Finax tablet is also prescribed at higher doses to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition commonly known as an enlarged prostate. This treatment helps alleviate symptoms of BPH, such as frequent or difficult urination.
