<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Carodyl Chewable tablets is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in dogs to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, joint disorders, and soft tissue or orthopedic surgeries. It works by blocking the production of certain chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Carodyl should be given exactly as prescribed by your veterinarian, usually once or twice daily. It can be given with or without food, but giving it with food may help reduce the risk of stomach upset. Ensure your dog has access to fresh water at all times and complete the full treatment course, even if your pet seems better.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Carodyl Chewable must be used with caution in dogs with liver, kidney, heart, or gastrointestinal problems. Regular monitoring through blood tests may be advised for dogs on long-term therapy to ensure the medicine remains safe and effective.

<strong>Contraindications</strong>

<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Carodyl Chewable tablets is generally well tolerated, but some dogs may experience mild side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or tiredness.
