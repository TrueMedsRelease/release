<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Levolin Inhaler is used to treat and prevent symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. It works by relaxing and widening the air passages in the lungs, making breathing easier. For those with asthma, it helps manage the condition by reducing the narrowing and swelling of the airways, while in COPD, it alleviates symptoms associated with emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> If you are using the inhaler for the first time or haven't used it for more than 3 days, remember to prime it by releasing 4 test sprays into the air. Shake the inhaler well before each use. Breathe out fully, place the mouthpiece in your mouth, and seal your lips around it. As you begin to breathe in slowly, press down on the inhaler one time. Continue to breathe in slowly until you've taken a full breath. Hold your breath for about 10 seconds to allow the medicine to reach deep into your lungs.
