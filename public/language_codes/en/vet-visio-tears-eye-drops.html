<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Visio Tears Eye Drops are used for dogs and cats to relieve dry, irritated eyes by lubricating the surface and mimicking natural tears, especially for conditions like keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). They contain ingredients like polyvinyl alcohol and povidone to add moisture and improve tear film stability, providing comfort and protecting the cornea from dryness.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Always use them as directed by a veterinarian, typically 1-2 drops in the affected eye as needed, and stop use if redness or cloudiness worsens, contacting your vet if irritation persists.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> When using Visio Tears for pets, always consult your vet first, avoid touching the dropper to the eye and surfaces to prevent contamination, stop use if irritation worsens or allergic signs (hives, swelling, trouble breathing) appear, and discard after one month open, using only for dogs and cats as directed for dryness relief, not as a cure-all.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Do not use if your pet is allergic or hypersensitive to Polyvinyl Alcohol, Povidone, or any other component in the preparation. Seek immediate veterinary care if signs of an allergic reaction appear, such as hives, swelling, itching, or difficulty breathing. Do not use if the solution changes color or becomes cloudy.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Visio Tears Eye Drops are generally well-tolerated but can cause temporary mild stinging, redness, or increased tearing, which usually subsides quickly. Serious side effects like severe swelling, hives, trouble breathing, or extreme redness warrant immediate vet contact, as they might signal an allergic reaction or underlying issue like infection, glaucoma, or ulcers.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Visio Tears Eye Drops are lubricating eye drops for dogs and cats, and there are no known drug interactions reported for this medication. They are generally considered safe and compatible with other water-soluble eye medications.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>

<br> Seek your veterinarian for emergency medical attention.
<br>
