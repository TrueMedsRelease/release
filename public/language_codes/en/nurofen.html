<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Nurofen (Ibuprofen) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. Nurofen is used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation caused by many conditions such as headache, toothache, back pain, arthritis, menstrual cramps, or minor injury.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use Nurofen exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor. Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition. The maximum amount of ibuprofen for adults is 800 milligrams per dose or 3200 mg per day (4 maximum doses). Take Nurofen with food or milk to lessen stomach upset.

<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Ask a doctor or pharmacist if this medicine is safe to use if you have ever had: heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or if you smoke; a heart attack, stroke, or blood clot; stomach ulcers or bleeding; liver or kidney disease; asthma; or if you take aspirin to prevent heart attack or stroke.

<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not use Nurofen if you are allergic to it, or if you have ever had an asthma attack or severe allergic reaction after taking aspirin or an NSAID.
<br> If you are pregnant, you should not take Nurofen (ibuprofen) unless your doctor tells you to. Taking an NSAID during the last 20 weeks of pregnancy can cause serious heart or kidney problems in the unborn baby and possible complications with your pregnancy.
