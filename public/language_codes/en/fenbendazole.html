<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Fenbendazole is a benzimidazole that presents a wide spectrum anthelmintic effect. It is used against a number of gastrointestinal parasites including giardia, roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, the Taenia genus of tapeworms, pinworms, aelurostrongylus, paragonimiasis, strongyles, and Strongyloides.
<br> Fenbendazole can also be used for preventing cancer progression. Fenbendazoleâ€™s action on microtubules may prevent the division of rapidly growing cells. Studies suggest Fenbendazole could restore function to p53, a critical gene in preventing cancer progression.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> 50 mg/kg daily for 3 consecutive days for the removal of ascarids (Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina), hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala), whipworms (Trichuris vulpis), and tapeworms (Taenia pisiformis).
<br> For cancer treatment, discuss dosage with your doctor.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Patients with compromised liver function, liver cirrhosis, or liver cancer should use Fenbendazole with caution. Additionally, combining Fenbendazole with glycolysis inhibitors and hepatoprotective pharmaceutical or nutraceutical agents can lead to synergic therapeutic activity while reducing potential liver toxicity.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Contraindications for Fenbendazole use include hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, pre-existing liver conditions, and pregnancy, as the safety of Fenbendazole during pregnancy has not been well established. Patients with these conditions should consult their healthcare provider before using the drug.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Adverse effects of Fenbendazole are rare but can include decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely reversible pancytopenia. Several reports suggest potential hepatotoxicty for Fenbendazole. A clinical trial reported liver enzyme abnormalities with oxfendazole, an activated Fenbendazole metabolite. A case of probable mild drug-induced liver injury (DILI) associated with Fenbendazole has been reported in a woman with lung cancer.

<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Combining Fenbendazole with glycolysis inhibitors and hepatoprotective pharmaceutical or nutraceutical agents can lead to synergic therapeutic activity while reducing potential liver toxicity. Also, the excretion of Methotrexate can be decreased when combined with Fenbendazole.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> A single overdose of Fenbendazole is unlikely to cause toxicity. Giving large overdoses of Fenbendazole over an extended period may lead to bone marrow suppression, resulting in abnormally low blood cell counts. If you suspect an overdose, immediately seek emergency medical attention.
<br>
