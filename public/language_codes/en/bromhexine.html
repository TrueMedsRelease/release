<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Bromhexine tablet is primarily used to manage respiratory disorders associated with thick or excessive mucus. It belongs to the class of medicines known as mucolytics that work by thinning and loosening mucus in your respiratory tract. In addition to this, this tablet also helps you breathe more easily and aids in clearing mucus from your respiratory tract. Its expectorant action enables you to cough out phlegm with less difficulty, relieving symptoms such as coughing, breathlessness, stuffiness, and wheezing.

<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Antitussives: Medicines like codeine and dextromethorphan might be affected when taken with Bromhexine. Suppressing a cough can lead to mucus retention, which may not be ideal when using a medicine that thins and loosens mucus.
<br> Antibiotics: If you're taking antibiotics such as amoxicillin or erythromycin, the efficacy of these medicines in treating respiratory tract infections could be enhanced due to increased penetration into bronchial secretions when used alongside Bromhexine.
