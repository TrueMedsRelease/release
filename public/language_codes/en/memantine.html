<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Memantine is used to treat moderate to severe dementia in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Memantine works to help relieve symptoms of AD by blocking NMDA receptors that, when persistently activated by glutamate, cause AD symptoms. While this mechanism helps to manage symptoms, memantine has not been shown to prevent or slow the underlying nerve degeneration associated with AD. Memantine belongs to the drug class called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists.
