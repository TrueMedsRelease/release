<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Duratia (dapoxetine) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) specifically designed to treat premature ejaculation in adult men aged 18 to 64 years. It works by raising serotonin levels in the nervous system, which helps delay ejaculation and improve control over it's timing. This enhances overall sexual satisfaction and increases the time it takes to ejaculate.
