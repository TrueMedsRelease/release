<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Melacare Forte Cream is used to manage moderate to severe melasma (dark spots on the skin). It contains hydroquinone, tretinoin, and mometasone furoate, which work together to lighten dark patches, reduce inflammation, and promote skin cell turnover. Apart from its primary use, this cream also reduces inflammation and promotes healthy skin cell turnover, which helps alleviate uneven skin texture. Thus, it significantly improves skin appearance and health.
