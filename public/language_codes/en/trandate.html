    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Trandate may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or lightheadedness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Trandate with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Trandate may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of these effects.
    <br>Patients who take medicine for high blood pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new symptoms.
    <br>Do not suddenly stop using Trandate without first checking with your doctor. Suddenly stopping Trandate may result in chest pain or temporary symptoms such as shaking, sweating, headache, irregular heartbeat, and general unwell feeling. If your doctor decides that you should stop using Trandate, your dosage should be reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and you should be carefully monitored.
    <br>Tell your doctor or dentist that you use Trandate before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery.
    <br>If you have a history of any severe allergic reaction, talk with your doctor. You may be at risk for an even more severe allergic reaction if you come into contact with the substance that caused your allergy. Some medicines used to treat severe allergies may also not work as well while you are using Trandate.
    <br>Trandate may interfere with certain lab tests. Be sure your doctor and lab personnel know you are using Trandate.
    <br>If your doctor has instructed you to check your blood pressure and heart rate regularly, be sure to do so.

    <br>Diabetes patients - Trandate may hide signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid heartbeat. Be sure to watch for other signs of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar may make you anxious, sweaty, weak, dizzy, drowsy, or faint. It may also make your vision change; give you a headache, chills, or tremors; or make you more hungry. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.
    <br>Lab tests, including kidney and liver function tests, may be performed while you use Trandate. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
