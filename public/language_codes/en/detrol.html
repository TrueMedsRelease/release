    <strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Take Detrol exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.
    <br>Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results.
    <br>Take Detrol with water. Do not crush, chew, break, or open a controlled-release capsule. Swallow it whole. Breaking or opening the pill may cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.
    <br>Store Detrol at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
    <br>If you missed a dose - take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.
    <br>The recommended dose of Detrol Capsules is 4 mg once daily with water and swallowed whole. The dose may be lowered to 2 mg daily based on individual response and tolerability; however, limited efficacy data are available for Detrol 2 mg.
    <br>For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) or severe renal impairment (CCr 10-30 mL/min), the recommended dose of Detrol is 2 mg once daily. Detrol is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Patients with CCKlO mL/min have not been studied and use of Detrol in this population is not recommended.
    <br>For patients who are taking drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 [e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir], the recommended dose of Detrol is 2 mg once daily.

    <br>This medication should not be used if you have certain medical conditions. Before using this medicine, consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have: problems emptying your bladder (urinary retention), severe blockage of stomach/intestines (gastric retention), a certain eye condition (uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma).

    <br>Tolterodine may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm (QT prolongation).

The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may affect the heart rhythm (see also Drug Interactions section). Before using tolterodine, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have any of the following conditions: certain heart problems (heart failure, slow heartbeat, QT prolongation in the EKG), family history of certain heart problems (QT prolongation in the EKG, sudden cardiac death).
    <br>Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. This risk may increase if you use certain drugs (such as diuretics/"water pills") or if you have conditions such as severe sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting. Talk to your doctor about using tolterodine safely.
