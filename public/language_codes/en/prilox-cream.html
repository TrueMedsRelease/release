<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Prilox Cream is used to manage and alleviate pain associated with various procedures such as grafts on skin or minor surgeries. This medicine is a combination product and forms part of the local anesthetics grouping of medicines. In addition to its primary use, this cream is also employed for its numbing effect during procedures that would otherwise be uncomfortable, like needle insertion, surgical interventions on the skin, or some dental procedures. It works by temporarily numbing the area where it's applied, making these procedures more comfortable.
