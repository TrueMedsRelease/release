<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Folic acid (vitamin B9) is a B vitamin supplement that may be used to prevent and treat folate deficiency (low blood levels of folate) that can cause megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid may also be used to control high levels of homocysteine, prevent serious birth defects in pregnant women or women who think they may be pregnant, and prevent methotrexate-induced folate deficiency in people prescribed methotrexate.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take folic acid exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take it in larger amounts or for longer than recommended. Folic acid tablets are usually taken by mouth with a full glass of water. Folic acid is an important nutrient and folate or folic acid should be consumed daily. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of folic acid for adults is 400 mcg DFE (dietary folate equivalents) daily.
