<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Pulmicort Inhaler is primarily used for the long-term management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It belongs to a class of medications known as corticosteroids. This medicine helps prevent symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath by controlling the inflammation in your lungs. It acts as a "preventer" medication rather than providing immediate relief during acute asthma attacks, meaning it works gradually to reduce the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms over time.
