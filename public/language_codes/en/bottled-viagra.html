<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Viagra is used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence) in men. Viagra relaxes muscles found in the walls of blood vessels and increases blood flow to particular areas of the body.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Viagra exactly as it was prescribed for you. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Viagra is usually taken only when needed, 30 minutes to 1 hour before sexual activity. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. Do not take Viagra more than once per day. Viagra can help you have an erection when sexual stimulation occurs. An erection will not occur just by taking a pill.

<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> To make sure Viagra is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: heart disease or heart rhythm problems, coronary artery disease; a heart attack, stroke, or congestive heart failure; high or low blood pressure; liver or kidney disease; a blood cell disorder such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia; a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia; a stomach ulcer; retinitis pigmentosa (an inherited condition of the eye); a physical deformity of the penis (such as Peyronie's disease); or if you have been told you should not have sexual intercourse for health reasons.
<br> Drinking alcohol with this medicine can cause side effects.
<br> Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with sildenafil and lead to unwanted side effects. Avoid the use of grapefruit products while taking sildenafil.
<br> Avoid using any other medicines to treat impotence, such as alprostadil or yohimbine, without first talking to your doctor.

<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not use Viagra if you are allergic to sildenafil, or: if you take other medicines to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, such as riociguat (Adempas); if you take nitrates.
<br> Do not take Viagra if you are also using a nitrate drug for chest pain or heart problems. This includes nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate. Nitrates are also found in some recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite ("poppers"). Taking sildenafil with a nitrate medicine can cause a sudden and serious decrease in blood pressure.
