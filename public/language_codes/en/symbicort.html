<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Symbicort is used to control and prevent the symptoms of asthma in adults and children at least 6 years old. Symbicort is also used to help control the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
<br> Symbicort inhaler contains a combination of budesonide and formoterol and is used for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Budesonide is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the body. Formoterol is a long-acting bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways to improve breathing.
