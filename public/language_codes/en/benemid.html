<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Benemid is used to treat gout and gouty arthritis. Benemid reduces the amount of uric acid in your body by causing it to be passed in your urine. Benemid is also sometimes given together with penicillin antibiotics (including ampicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or nafcillin) to make them more effective.
