<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Phexin capsule belongs to the class of antibiotics known as cephalosporins. Cephalosporins are a set of antibiotics that are structurally and chemically related to penicillin. Phexin capsule is most effective against gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and some strains of Enterococcus. It is also active against gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli (Escherichia coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Phexin capsules should be taken as your doctor recommends. Swallow it as a whole with water after your meal to avoid stomach discomfort. Do not cut, break or chew the medicine. It would be best to take it at a fixed time for optimal results.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Colitis: Colitis is the inflammation of the colon's lining. Antibiotics such as Phexin capsule can disrupt the normal gut flora, leading to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria like Clostridium difficile. This can cause a type of colitis called antibiotic-associated colitis or pseudomembranous colitis. Patients with a history of colitis or diarrhoea should use Phexin capsule judiciously.
<br> Seizure disorders: Patients with a history of seizure disorders such as epilepsy should use Phexin capsule carefully, as it can lower the seizure threshold and raise the likelihood of seizures.
<br> Dialysis: Phexin capsule is mainly excreted by the kidneys. Patients with severe kidney dysfunction, including those on dialysis, should use the Phexin capsule cautiously under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
<br> Kidney and liver dysfunction: Patients with pre-existing kidney or liver dysfunction should use Phexin capsule cautiously, as it can worsen the condition.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Patients allergic to cephalosporin or penicillin antibiotics should not take Phexin capsules. It is crucial to inform a healthcare provider of known allergies before taking.
<br> If you're pregnant, it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider before taking Phexin capsules. Because there is limited data on its safety for pregnant women, it should only be used when necessary.
<br> Patients with liver problems might require a reduced dose of Phexin capsules or may not be able to take it at all. Also patients with kidney problems may require a lower dose of Phexin capsules or may not be able to take it at all.

<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Diarrhoea is a common side effect of Phexin capsules, as antibiotics can disrupt the average balance of bacteria in the gut, leading to diarrhoea. In most cases, the diarrhoea is mild and self-limiting, but in some cases, it can be severe and persistent. If you experience severe or bloody diarrhoea, contact your healthcare provider immediately.
<br> Nausea and vomiting are also typical side effects of Phexin capsules. You should contact your physician if you experience persistent or severe nausea and vomiting.
<br> Indigestion and stomach pain are common side effects of Phexin capsules. These side effects are usually mild and can resolve efficiently. However, you should contact your healthcare provider if you experience severe or persistent stomach pain.
<br> Skin rashes are also a possible side effect of Phexin capsules that range from mild to severe and may co-occur with itching, swelling, or blistering. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you develop a skin rash while taking Phexin.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Antibiotics: Phexin capsule may interact with other antibiotics such as capreomycin, vancomycin, gentamicin, neomycin, tobramycin, and cefuroxime. The concomitant use of these antibiotics with a Phexin may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Therefore, when taking these medications together, blood sugar and kidney function monitoring is recommended.
<br> Antidiabetic: Phexin capsule may interact with antidiabetic medications such as metformin. The concomitant use of Phexin with metformin may raise the risk of lactic acidosis, a rare but severe side effect. Therefore, blood sugar and kidney function monitoring is recommended when taking these medications together.
<br> Diuretics: Phexin capsule may interact with diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide. The concomitant use of Phexin with these diuretics may increase the risk of kidney toxicity. Therefore, monitoring kidney function regularly when taking these medications together is essential.
<br> Oral anticoagulants: Medication such as warfarin may prolong prothrombin time when combined with cephalosporins.
<br> Typhoid vaccine: Antibacterial activity against salmonella typhi organisms may interfere with the immunological response to the live typhoid vaccine. The appropriate time should elapse between the administration of the last dose of the antibiotic and the live typhoid vaccine.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> If you forgot to take the Phexin, take it as soon as you recall or contact your healthcare provider. If the time for the next dosage is close, skipping the missed one is recommended now and resume your regular dosage pattern. Never increase your dosage without consulting your doctor.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> If you or someone else takes excessive Phexin by accident, it is essential to take immediate medical attention from your doctor or nearby hospital. An overdose's symptoms include brain damage and may cause headache, dizziness and stomach upset.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
<br>
<br> Store Phexin capsules at room temperature (15-25ÂºC). Please protect it from light and moisture. Keep Phexin capsules away from children. Do not use the Phexin after the expiry date has passed.
