<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Retrovir is an antiviral medicine used to treat HIV, the virus that can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This medicine is also given during pregnancy to prevent an HIV-infected woman from passing the virus to her baby.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Follow all directions on your prescription. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Retrovir oral is taken by mouth, usually in combination with other antiviral medications. Retrovir oral can be taken with or without food.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Tell your doctor if you have ever had: kidney disease; muscle problems; a latex allergy (if you receive Retrovir injection); bone marrow suppression; anemia (low red blood cells); or if you drink large amounts of alcohol.
<br> Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, and use your medications properly to control your infection. HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy.
<br> Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.
<br>
<br>

<br> You may develop lactic acidosis, a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. Get emergency medical help if you have unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, irregular heartbeats, dizziness, vomiting, or if you feel cold, tired, or very weak.
