<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Snovitra tablets are a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. The active ingredient in Snovitra is vardenafil, which belongs to a class of drugs known as phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Vardenafil works by increasing blood flow to the penis, thereby helping men achieve and maintain an erection during sexual activity.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Snovitra is usually taken orally, about 30-60 minutes before sexual activity. The tablet should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. The effects of vardenafil can last for up to 4-6 hours, providing a window of time during which the medication can facilitate erections. Itâ€™s important to note that sexual stimulation is still required for vardenafil to work effectively, as the medication does not induce an erection without arousal.
