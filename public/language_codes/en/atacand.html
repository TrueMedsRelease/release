<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Atacand is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (sometimes called an ARB). Candesartan keeps blood vessels from narrowing, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow. Atacand is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children who are at least 1 year old. Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack. Atacand is also used in adults to treat certain types of heart failure and lower your risk of death or needing to be hospitalized for heart damage.
