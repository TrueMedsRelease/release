<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Inderal LA is used to treat high blood pressure, angina (chest pain), heart rhythm disorders, prevent migraines. It helps by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate, improving blood flow and reducing heart workload. Inderal LA belongs to a class of medications known as non-selective beta-blockers, which work by blocking the effects of certain chemicals in the body that influence the heart and blood vessels. This action helps lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
