<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Podofilox topical (for the skin) is used to treat genital warts that appear on the outside of the body, but podofilox topical is not a cure for genital warts. Podofilox prevents the growth of certain types of cells.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> This medicine is usually applied in the morning and evening for 3 days in a row, followed by 4 days of not using the medicine. This 7-day treatment cycle should be repeated up to 4 times, or until you can no longer see any signs of wart tissue.
<br> Wash your hands before applying podofilox topical. Also wash the skin area to be treated, and allow it to dry completely before applying the medicine. Apply podofilox topical using the cotton applicator provided or with your finger. Apply the medicine only to the wart tissue and avoid getting it on healthy skin. If the genital wart is in a skin fold, spread the skin apart and apply the medicine. Allow the treated skin to dry before releasing the skin fold. Wash your hands again after applying podofilox topical.
