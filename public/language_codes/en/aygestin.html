<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Aygestin (Norethindrone) is a form of progesterone, a female hormone important for regulating ovulation and menstruation. Aygestin is used for birth control (contraception) to prevent pregnancy. Aygestin is also used to treat menstrual disorders, endometriosis, or abnormal vaginal bleeding caused by a hormone imbalance.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.
<br> If you take Aygestin for contraception: Take one pill every day, no more than 24 hours apart. You may get pregnant if you do not take one pill daily.
<br> If you take Aygestin for menstrual disorders or abnormal vaginal bleeding: You will most likely take the medicine for only 5 to 10 days. Vaginal bleeding will occur 3 to 7 days after your last dose.
<br> If you take Aygestin for endometriosis: Aygestin is usually taken daily long-term for several months. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.

<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Some drugs can make Aygestin (norethindrone) less effective, which may result in unintended pregnancy if you use Aygestin for contraception.

<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Call your doctor for instructions, or follow the patient instructions provided with your medicine. Missing a birth control pill increases your risk of becoming pregnant. If you are more than 3 hours late for your dose, take the medicine as soon as you remember and use back-up birth control for at least 48 hours. Take your next pill at the regularly scheduled time and continue on your regular dosing schedule.
