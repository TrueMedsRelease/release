<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Astelin is an antihistamine that reduces the effects of natural chemical histamine in the body. Histamine can produce symptoms of sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose. Astelin nasal spray is used to treat sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itching, and other nasal symptoms of allergies, in adults and children who are at least 5 years old. Astelin is also used to treat ongoing nasal symptoms (runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, itching) that are not caused by allergies, in adults and children who are at least 12 years old.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use Astelin nasal spray exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes. Place the spray tip into 1 nostril. Hold bottle upright and aim the spray tip toward the back of your nose. Close your other nostril with a finger. Press the pump 1 time and sniff gently at the same time, keeping your head tilted forward and down. Repeat in your other nostril. If your healthcare provider tells you to use 2 sprays in each nostril, repeat Steps 2 through 4 above for the second spray in each nostril. When you finish using your Astelin Nasal Spray, wipe the spray tip with a clean tissue or cloth. Put the safety clip and dust cover back on the bottle.
