<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Flibanserin used to treat decreased sexual desire in women who have not gone through menopause and who have never had low sexual desire in the past. Flibanserin is for use only when low sexual desire is not caused by a medical condition, a mental disorder, relationship problems, or by using drugs or other medicines.
<br> Flibanserin preferentially activates 5-HT1A receptors in the prefrontal cortex demonstrating regional selectivity, and has been found to increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels and decrease serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex, actions that were determined to be mediated by activation of the 5-HT1A receptor.
