<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Levitra is used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence; inability to get or keep an erection) in men. Levitra works by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation. This increased blood flow can cause an erection. Levitra (vardenafil) belongs to a class of medications called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Levitra exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Levitra can be taken with or without food. Levitra is taken only when needed, about 60 minutes before sexual activity. The medicine can help achieve an erection when sexual stimulation occurs. An erection will not occur just by taking a pill.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> To make sure Levitra is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: heart disease, heart rhythm problems; a heart attack, stroke, or congestive heart failure; long QT syndrome (in you or a family member); high or low blood pressure; seizure (convulsions); a blood cell disorder such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia; a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia; a stomach ulcer; hearing or vision problems, vision loss; an eye disorder such as retinitis pigmentosa (an inherited condition of the eye); a physical deformity of the penis (such as Peyronie's disease); if you have been told you should not have sexual intercourse for health reasons; or liver disease, kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis).

<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not use Levitra if you are allergic to vardenafil, or if you take other medicines to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, such as riociguat (Adempas).
<br> Do not take Levitra if you are also using a nitrate drug for chest pain or heart problems, including nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate. Nitrates are also found in some recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite ("poppers"). Taking vardenafil with a nitrate medicine can cause a sudden and serious decrease in blood pressure.
