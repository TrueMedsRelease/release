<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Diltiazem HCL is used in adults alone or in combination with other medicines to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) or symptoms of angina (chest pain). Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack. Diltiazem HCL belongs to a class of medications called calcium-channel blockers. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. Diltiazem also increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.

<br> Beta-blockers: These medicines, like atenolol or metoprolol, can intensify the blood pressure-lowering effect of Diltiazem HCL, possibly leading to a severe drop in blood pressure.
<br> Digoxin: Diltiazem HCL can increase the body's absorption of digoxin, which might necessitate close monitoring of digoxin levels in your body.
<br> Statins: Medicines like atorvastatin or lovastatin may have their levels increased in the body when taken with Diltiazem HCL due to its inhibitory effect on the CYP3A4 enzyme pathway.
