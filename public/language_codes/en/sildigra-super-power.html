<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Sildigra Super Power is a combination medication containing Sildenafil Citrate and Dapoxetine Hydrochloride. It is used to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) and Premature Ejaculation (PE) in adult men. Sildenafil increases blood flow to the penis by stopping the PDE-5 enzyme and increasing cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) levels, helping men achieve a firm erection when sexually stimulated. Dapoxetine inhibits contraction responses during sexual activities, preventing premature ejaculation. Together, these actions address both ED and PE.
