<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Bactroban Ointment is an antibiotic medicine used to treat certain skin infections such as impetigo (red sores), recurring boils, and others. It works by killing certain bacteria. This helps to improve your symptoms and cure the underlying infection.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Bactroban Ointment is meant for external use only. It should be applied only to the affected area of the skin as per the dosage and schedule prescribed by your doctor. In order to get the most benefit, apply it regularly and preferably at the same time each day. Do not use larger amounts or apply it more often or for a longer duration than directed. This will only increase the risk of side effects. Do not use it for more than 10 days. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get the medicine in these areas.
