<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Isofair is a prescribed medicine primarily used to manage severe acne like nodular or conglobate acne, or acne which is at a risk of causing permanent scarring that has not responded well to other treatments. This medication is part of the retinoid class of medicines, which are powerful derivatives of vitamin A. In addition to its primary use, it helps reduce the skin's production of sebum - an oily substance that can clog pores and cause acne breakouts. By reducing sebum production, this medicine makes the skin less hospitable for acne-causing bacteria, leading to clearer skin and preventing new acne lesions from forming.
