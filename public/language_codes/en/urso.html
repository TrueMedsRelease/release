<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Urso (Ursodiol) capsules are used to dissolve small gallstones that cannot be removed with surgery, or to prevent gallstones that may occur during rapid weight loss. Urso will not dissolve calcified gallstones. Urso capsules are used also to treat primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune disorder that causes progressive destruction of the bile ducts in your liver. Urso (Ursodiol) is also known as ursodeoxycholic acid.
