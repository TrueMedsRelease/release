<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Lincocin is an antibiotic that is used to treat severe bacterial infections in people who cannot use penicillin antibiotics. Lincocin is used only for a severe infection. Lincocin will not treat a viral infection such as the common cold or flu.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Lincocin is injected into a muscle, or as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.
<br> When injected into a vein, Lincocin must be given slowly, and the infusion can take at least 1 hour to complete.
<br> Lincocin is sometimes given as an injection into your eye. Your doctor will use a medicine to numb your eye before giving you the injection. You will receive this injection in your doctor's office or other clinic setting.
<br> Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Skipping doses can increase your risk of infection that is resistant to medication.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Antibiotic medicine can cause overgrowth of normally harmless bacteria in the intestines. This can lead to an infection that causes mild to severe diarrhea, even months after your last antibiotic dose. Call your doctor at the first sign of diarrhea during and shortly after your treatment with Lincocin.
<br> If you have diarrhea that is watery or bloody, stop using Lincocin and call your doctor right away. Do not use anti-diarrhea medicine unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping the diarrhea can make an intestinal infection worse.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not be treated with Lincocin if you are allergic to Lincocin or clindamycin.
<br> Before you receive Lincocin, tell your doctor if you have a history of intestinal disorder such as ulcerative colitis.
<br> Tell your doctor if you have ever had: asthma; an intestinal disorder such as colitis; severe allergies; or liver or kidney disease.
<br> It is not known whether Lincocin will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.
