<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Fiprofort Plus Spot-On is a medicine used to treat and prevent parasitic infestations in dogs and cats. It effectively kills fleas, ticks, and lice, and also stops the growth of flea eggs, larvae, and pupae. It targets both adult and immature parasite stages and provides complete and long-lasting protection.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Fiprofort Plus Spot-On should be used as per your veterinarian’s advice. Part the fur at the base until the skin is visible and apply the contents directly onto the skin. Ensure the application site is dry before allowing your pet to mix with others or be handled. To get the most benefit, apply as often as the veterinarian has instructed. Clean the vacuum, the beddings, carpets, and resting areas to help eliminate fleas from the environment and improve the treatment’s effectiveness.

<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Fiprofort Plus Spot-On is for external use only and should not be used on puppies or kittens younger than 8 weeks or on sick or recovering animals. Avoid contact with your pet’s eyes, mouth, and skin during application, and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Prevent the treated animals from licking each other until the site is completely dry.
