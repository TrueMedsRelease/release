<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Varnitrip (Varenicline) is a smoking cessation aid that is used alongside education and counseling to help people stop smoking. Varnitrip works by binding to nicotinic receptors, stimulating these receptors at a much lower level than nicotine, while at the same time preventing nicotine from binding to these same receptors. This decreases nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms that happen when people stop smoking. It belongs to the class of medicines called smoking cessation aids.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Varnitrip is an oral tablet that is taken twice a day. The most common way to start taking varenicline is at least one week before you quit, at a low dose (varenicline 0.5 mg), which is gradually increased over 8 days to varenicline 1 mg twice a day. Take Varnitrip with food or soon after eating and with a full glass of water to minimize potential nausea from the medications.
