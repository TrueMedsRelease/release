<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> KamaSutra Longlast Condoms is used for providing protection against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). They are made with premium-quality natural rubber latex and designed to provide greater sensitivity during sexual intercourse. These condoms are electronically tested for any imperfections. These condoms come with a unique lubricant containing benzocaine, a mild desensitising agent that helps prolong the experience, ensuring mutual satisfaction. These are designed with a flared base that adds an extra layer of safety, managing slippage and enhancing security during use.

<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Put on the condom before engaging in sexual intercourse. The roll of the condom should be on the outside. The end of the condom must be squeezed before putting it on to release any air trapped inside. While squeezing the end with one hand, one should put the condom on top of the genital and roll it with the other. Once ejaculation is reached, and while the genital is still erect, hold the condom firmly and take it off carefully.

<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> This product is for single use only. Seek medical assistance as soon as possible, at least within 72 hrs, if the condom leaks/ bursts during use.
<br> Condoms significantly reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancies and STIs but do not guarantee 100% protection.

<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> KamaSutra Longlast Condoms are primarily contraindicated for individuals with a known allergy to natural rubber latex. They should not be used if the package is expired or damaged. Additionally, avoiding oil-based lubricants (like lotions or petroleum jelly) is necessary, as they can break down the latex and cause the condom to tear.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> KamaSutra Longlast Condoms are generally safe, but potential side effects, often due to ingredients like latex or benzocaine, include mild irritation, discomfort, rash, or itching. These condoms feature a lubricant (4.5% benzocaine) designed to delay climax and a dotted texture, which may cause sensitivity or irritation in some users.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Only use water-based or silicone-based lubricants with these condoms. Do not use oil-based lubricants (such as petroleum jelly, baby oil, or lotions), as they can weaken the latex and cause the condom to break. Avoid using other topical creams, oils, or medications on the genital area simultaneously, as they may interfere with the efficacy of the condom or the benzocaine, or damage the latex.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
<br>
<br> Store the condoms in a cool and dry place. Protect from heat and direct sunlight. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets. Do not use a condom after the expiry date (indicated on each pack).
