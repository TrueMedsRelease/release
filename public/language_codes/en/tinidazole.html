    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Tinidazole may cause drowsiness or dizziness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Tinidazole with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Avoid drinking alcohol or taking products that contain alcohol while taking Tinidazole and for 3 days after the last dose.
    <br>Tinidazole only works against bacteria and parasites; it does not treat viral infections (eg, the common cold).
    <br>Be sure to use Tinidazole for the full course of treatment. If you do not, the medicine may not clear up your infection completely. The bacteria or parasites could also become less sensitive to this or other medicines. This could make the infection harder to treat in the future.
    <br>Tinidazole may discolor or darken the urine. This is normal and not a cause for concern.
    <br>Hormonal birth control (eg, birth control pills) may not work as well while you are using Tinidazole. To prevent pregnancy, use an extra form of birth control (eg, condoms).
    <br>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take Tinidazole before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery.
    <br>Tinidazole may interfere with certain lab tests. Be sure your doctor and lab personnel know you are taking Tinidazole.
    <br>Lab tests, including blood cell counts, may be performed while you use Tinidazole. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use Tinidazole with extreme caution in children younger 3 years; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
    <br>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Tinidazole may cause harm to the fetus. Tinidazole should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. If you think you may be pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Tinidazole while you are pregnant. Tinidazole is found in breast milk. Do not breast-feed while taking Tinidazole and for 3 days after you have taken the last dose.
