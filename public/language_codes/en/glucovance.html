<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Glucovance is a combination of two orally taken drugs possessing a hyproglycemic effect which belong to two different groups: metformin and glibenclamide. Metformin belongs to biguanide class of substances and decreases blood levels of glucose by increasity susceptibility of peripheral tissues to action of insulin. Metmorfin decreases absorption of carbohydrates in gastrointestinal tract and inhibits synthesis of glucose in the liver. Glibenclamide is a derivate of sulfonylurea and acts stimulating secretion of insulin by Î²-cells of the pancreas. It is used along with a diet and exercise program to to treat type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent diabetes).

<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Cimetidine (Tagamet) increases blood levels of Glucovance affecting its metabolism.
<br> Glucovance is not compatible with alcohol.
<br> Concomitant administration with indirect anticoagulants and Cimetidine should be done with cautiousness.
<br> Glucovance enhances metabolism of Furosemide.
<br> Derivatives of sulfonylurea, insulin, acarbose, inhibitors of MAO, ACE inhibitors (such as captopril), oxytetracycline, cyclophosphamide and salicylates increase the effects of Glucovance.
<br> Decrease of hypoglycemic effect of Glucovance is caused by co-administration with thyroid medicines, birth control pills and other hormones, epinephrine, glucagon, thiazide diuretics, nicotinic acid derivates.
<br> Azole antifungals (fluconazole) also interact with Glucovance.
