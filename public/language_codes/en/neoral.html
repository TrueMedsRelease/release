<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Neoral is used to prevent organ rejection after a kidney, liver, or heart transplant. Neoral lowers your body's immune system. The immune system helps your body fight infections. The immune system can also fight or "reject" a transplanted organ such as a liver or kidney. This is because the immune system treats the new organ as an invader.
