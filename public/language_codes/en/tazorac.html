<br> Tazorac is used to treat acne vulgaris in adults and adolescents who are at least 12 years old. Tazorac is also used to treat plaque psoriasis (raised, silvery flaking of the skin) in adults. Tazorac is a compound similar to vitamin A. It helps the skin to renew itself more quickly and may improve the appearance and texture of skin. Tazorac is available as a cream or gel.
