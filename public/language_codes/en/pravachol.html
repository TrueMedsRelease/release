<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Pravachol belongs to a group of drugs called HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or "statins." Pravachol is used together with diet to lower blood levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL), to increase levels of "good" cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL), and to lower triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood). Pravachol is also used to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other heart complications in people with or without coronary heart disease or other risk factors.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Pravachol exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Take the medicine at the same time each day, with or without food. Pravastatin doses are based on age, and are lower in children and teenagers. People taking this medicine during childhood or adolescence may need a different dose as adults. It may take up to 4 weeks before your cholesterol levels improve.

<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> To make sure Pravachol is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: kidney disease; abnormal liver function tests; muscle pain or weakness; a thyroid disorder; or if you drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages daily.
<br> Avoid eating foods high in fat or cholesterol, or pravastatin will not be as effective.
<br> Avoid drinking alcohol. It can raise triglyceride levels and may increase your risk of liver damage.
<br> Grapefruit may interact with pravastatin and lead to unwanted side effects. Avoid the use of grapefruit products.
