<p><strong>Product Description<br></strong><br><strong> Common use<br></strong><br> Zantac is a blocker of H2-histamine receptors. The mechanism of action consists in the blockade of histamine H2-receptors of parietal cells in gastric mucous layer. This medication suppresses day and night secretion of HCl (both basal and stimulated), reduces the amount of gastric juices caused by stretching of the stomach with food load and by the action of hormones and biogenic stimulants such as gastrin, histamine, acetylcholine, pentagastrin, caffeine. Zantac reduces the amount of HCl in gastric juice almost without suppressing "liver" enzymes associated with cytochrome P450. It does not affect the concentration of gastrin in plasma, production of mucus. Zantac reduces pepsin activity. This medication is used to treat and prevent stomach and duodenal ulcers, gastrointestinal disorders caused by NSAID, heartburn, hypersecretion of gastric juice, symptomatic ulcers, ulcers caused by stress, erosive esophagitis, reflux esophagitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other conditions.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and direction<br></strong><br> Take it orally with or without food.
