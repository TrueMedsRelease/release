<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Relpax is a headache medicine that narrows blood vessels around the brain. Eletriptan also reduces substances in the body that can trigger headache pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and other migraine symptoms. Relpax is used to treat migraine headaches with or without aura in adults. Relpax will only treat a headache that has already begun. It will not prevent headaches or reduce the number of attacks.

<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Relpax as soon as you notice migraine symptoms. After taking a tablet: If your headache does not completely go away, or goes away and comes back, take a second tablet 2 hours after the first. Do not take more than 80 mg of Relpax in 24 hours. If your symptoms have not improved, contact your doctor before taking any more tablets.
