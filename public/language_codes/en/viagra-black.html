<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Viagra Black is a high-potency version of the original Viagra, designed to treat Erectile dysfunction (ED) and Impotence in men with more severe or resistant cases. It contains a stronger dose of Sildenafil Citrate, which enhances blood flow to the penis and helps achieve a firm, lasting erection during sexual stimulation. Viagra Black is intended for men who have not responded to standard ED treatments. It offers an extended duration of action and is often used when maximum efficacy is needed.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Viagra Black is typically taken as one tablet about 30 - 60 minutes before planned sexual activity. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. Do not take more than one tablet in 24 hours, and avoid taking it with high-fat meals, which may reduce absorption. Always follow your healthcare provider’s instructions, especially with high-strength medications like this.

<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> To make sure Viagra Black is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: heart disease or heart rhythm problems, coronary artery disease; a heart attack, stroke, or congestive heart failure; high or low blood pressure; liver or kidney disease; a blood cell disorder such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia; a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia; a stomach ulcer; retinitis pigmentosa (an inherited condition of the eye); a physical deformity of the penis (such as Peyronie's disease); or if you have been told you should not have sexual intercourse for health reasons.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> You should not use Viagra Black if you are allergic to sildenafil, or: if you take other medicines to treat Erectile dysfunction; if you take other medicines to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, such as riociguat (Adempas); if you take nitrates.
<br> Do not take Viagra Black if you are also using a nitrate drug for chest pain or heart problems. This includes nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate. Nitrates are also found in some recreational drugs such as amyl nitrate or nitrite ("poppers"). Taking sildenafil with a nitrate medicine can cause a sudden and serious decrease in blood pressure.

<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Call your doctor at once if you have: ringing in your ears, or sudden hearing loss; irregular heartbeat; swelling in your hands, ankles, or feet; shortness of breath; seizure (convulsions); or a light-headed feeling, like you might pass out.
<br> Common Viagra Black side effects may include: flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling); headache, dizziness; abnormal vision (blurred vision, changes in color vision); runny or stuffy nose, nosebleeds; sleep problems (insomnia); muscle pain, back pain; or upset stomach.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Do not take Viagra Black with similar medications such as avanafil (Stendra), tadalafil (Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra). Tell your doctor about all other medications you use for Erectile dysfunction.
<br> Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using, especially: drugs to treat high blood pressure or a prostate disorder; an antibiotic - clarithromycin, erythromycin, or telithromycin; antifungal medicine - ketoconazole or itraconazole; or medicine to treat HIV/AIDS - atazanavir, indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir; nitrates; medications used to treat pulmonary artery hypertension.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Viagra Black is taken as needed, not on a regular schedule. Therefore, missed doses are not typically a concern. Take only when planning sexual activity, and never double the dose to make up for a missed opportunity. Wait 24 hours before taking another pill.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Overdosing on Viagra Black may result in serious health issues, including chest pain, fainting, severe hypotension, or prolonged erection lasting over 4 hours. Seek immediate emergency care if overdose symptoms appear. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, especially with this high-strength version. Overdose increases both side effects and risk of complications.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
<br>
<br> Store Viagra Black at room temperature between 15 - 30°C (59 - 86°F) in a dry, dark place. Keep it away from moisture, heat, and direct sunlight. Do not use it past the expiration date printed on the packaging. Keep out of reach of children and pets.
