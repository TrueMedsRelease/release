<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes in certain patients to improve and maintain blood glucose levels.

<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use the medicine exactly as directed. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand how to use an injection. Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use it if the medicine looks cloudy, has changed colors, or has particles in it. Insulin glargine is injected under the skin, using a syringe or insulin pen, once per day at the same time of day.
<br> Insulin can be injected into your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Do not inject into the same place two times in a row. Avoid injecting into skin that is damaged, tender, bruised, pitted, thickened, scaly, or has a scar or hard lump.
<br> When treating type 1 diabetes, use your short-acting insulin before meals as directed by your doctor.
