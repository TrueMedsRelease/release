<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Xeloda is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth of cancer cells and slows their spread in the body. Xeloda is used alone or in combination chemotherapy to treat colon cancer, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer. Xeloda is sometimes used when cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).
