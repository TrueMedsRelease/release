<p><strong>Product Description<br></strong><br><strong> Common use<br></strong><br> Cleocin kills sensitive bacteria by stopping the production of essential bacterial proteins after binding a bacterial ribosome. Cleocin is close by its qualities to Lincomycin. Lincosamides are usually used to treat staphylococci and streptococci. Cleocin is administered to treat protozoal diseases such as malaria, infections of respiratory system, skin and soft tissures, bones and joints, abdominal organs, and others. It does not treat meningitis.<br><br> <strong>Dosage and directions<br></strong><br> Take orally four times a day with or without food with a full glass of water. Take Cleocin at evenly spaced intervals. <br><br> <strong>Precautions<br></strong><br> This medication should be used only for treatment of serious bacterial infections due to its ability to cause severe and even fatal intestinal condition known as pseudomembranous colitis. This condition may appear during treatment or even weeks after treatment has stopped. So if you have persistent diarrhea, abdominal or stomach pain/cramping, or blood/mucus in your stool do not use anti-diarrhea drugs and inform your doctor about your condition. <br><br> <strong>Contraindications<br></strong><br> Do not take this drug if you have antibiotic-associated colitis, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis or meningitis, have allergy to Cleocin or Lincomycides.
