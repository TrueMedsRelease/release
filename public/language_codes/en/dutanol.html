<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Dutanol is a prescription medicine primarily used to manage benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult men. BPH is a condition where the prostate gland becomes enlarged, which can cause urinary problems. This medicine belongs to a class of medications known as 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. This medicine also improves urinary symptoms associated with this condition. It decreases the risk of acute urinary retention, which is the inability to pass urine, and lessens the chance of needing prostate surgery.
