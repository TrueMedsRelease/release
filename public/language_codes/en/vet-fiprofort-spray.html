<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Fiprofort Spray (Fipronil) is an antiparasitic medicine used to treat and prevent infestations caused by fleas, ticks, and lice in dogs and cats. It works by paralyzing and killing these parasites on contact. It also helps manage flea allergy dermatitis and keeps your pet’s coat healthy and comfortable.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Use Fiprofort Spray exactly as directed by your veterinarian. Apply the medicine evenly over your pet’s body until the coat is slightly damp. Apply in a well-ventilated area, or outdoors, and allow the coat to air-dry naturally without towel drying. Avoid bathing your pet for at least two days before and after treatment to maintain effectiveness. Regular use is advised to prevent reinfestation and keep your pet free from external parasites.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Avoid applying Fiprofort Spray near the eyes, mouth, or open wounds. Do not allow pets to lick the spray while it is wet, and keep them away from open flames or heat sources until the coat is completely dry, as the product is flammable. Wear gloves while applying, wash your hands afterward, and avoid eating or smoking around your pet while using this medicine. Pregnant and lactating pets may be treated safely under veterinary supervision.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Fiprofort Spray is contraindicated in rabbits, sick or convalescent animals, pets with known hypersensitivity to fipronil, insecticides or alcohol, and very young puppies and kittens (typically under 8 weeks or 2 months or 2kg weight). Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and skin during application, and prevent pets from licking it while wet.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> There is limited data on the common side effects of Fiprofort Spray. Some animals may experience mild and temporary reactions, such as skin irritation, redness, or itching at the site of application. These effects usually resolve on their own. If your pet shows persistent irritation, excessive salivation, or signs of discomfort after application, rinse the affected area with water and consult your veterinarian immediately.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> There are no known specific drug interactions with Fiprofort Spray (fipronil). The medication works topically on the skin and coat rather than being absorbed into the bloodstream, which minimizes the potential for systemic drug interactions.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Give the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not give two doses at one time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek your veterinarian for emergency medical attention.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
