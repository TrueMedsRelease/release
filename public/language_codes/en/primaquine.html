<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Primaquine is a medication to treat or prevent malaria, a disease caused by parasites. primaquine works by interfering with the growth of parasites in the body.
<br> Vivax malaria is a form of malaria in which parasites travel from the bloodstream into other cells and tissues of the body. This can cause a second infection (relapse) to occur. Primaquine is used to prevent malaria from coming back in people who have been infected with the vivax form of this disease.
