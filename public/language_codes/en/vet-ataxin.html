<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Ataxin is a medicine used in dogs and cats for the treatment of bacterial infections. It is effective against infections of the alimentary, respiratory, and urinary tracts, as well as skin infections, wound infections, and ear infections. It works by killing and clearing the bacterial infection.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Ataxin should be given exactly as prescribed by your veterinarian. It can be given with or without food. The dose and duration will depend on the severity and type of infection. The recommended dosage for Ataxin tablets is: 5 mg/kg body weight once daily for 5-10 days, or as prescribed by a veterinarian.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Do not exceed the prescribed dose, especially in cats, as overdosing may cause eye (retinal) damage. Use during pregnancy and lactation should be based on veterinary assessment.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> Ataxin should not be used in animals allergic to fluoroquinolones or in young dogs less than one year old (or under 18 months in large breeds), as it may affect joint cartilage development. It is also not recommended for kittens younger than eight weeks.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> Ataxin is generally well tolerated, but mild digestive upsets such as vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite may occur. In young animals, this medicine may affect developing joints if given during rapid growth. If your pet shows unusual symptoms like persistent vomiting, lameness, or eye discomfort, contact your veterinarian immediately.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> Avoid giving Ataxin with certain antibiotics like tetracyclines, macrolides, or chloramphenicol, as these can reduce its effectiveness. Inform your veterinarian about any other medications or supplements your pet is taking.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Give the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not give two doses at one time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek your veterinarian for emergency medical attention.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
<br>
<br> Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep out of reach of the children and pets.
