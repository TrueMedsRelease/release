<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Protopic ointment is used to treat the symptoms of moderate to severe eczema in adults and children at least 2 years old, who cannot use other medications for their condition or whose eczema has not responded to another medication. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a skin disease that causes the skin to be dry and itchy and to sometimes develop red, scaly rashes). Protopic (tacrolimus) is a topical macrolide immunosuppressant that belongs to a class of medications called topical calcineurin inhibitors. Tacrolimus works by decreasing cell activity in the body's immune system which helps to slow down the growth of atopic dermatitis (eczema) on your skin.
