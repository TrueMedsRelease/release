    <br> 
    <strong>Common use</strong>
    <br>Sumycin is used for treating infections caused by certain bacteria. Sumycin is a tetracycline antibiotic. It works by slowing the growth of sensitive bacteria by interfering with the production of proteins needed by the bacteria to grow. Slowing the bacteria's growth allows the body's defense mechanisms to destroy them.

    <br><b>Important safety information:</b>
    <br>Sumycin may cause dizziness or blurred vision. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Sumycin with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
    <br>Contact your doctor right away if stomach pain or cramps, severe diarrhea, or bloody stools occur. Do not treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor.
    <br>Be sure to use Sumycin for the full course of treatment. If you do not, the medicine may not clear up your infection completely. The bacteria could also become less sensitive to this or other medicines. This could make the infection harder to treat in the future.
    <br>Sumycin may cause you to become sunburned more easily. Avoid the sun, sunlamps, or tanning booths until you know how you react to Sumycin. Use a sunscreen or wear protective clothing if you must be outside for more than a short time.
    <br>Do not use after expiration date. Outdated medicine is highly toxic to the kidneys.
    <br>Long-term or repeated use of Sumycin may cause a second infection. Tell your doctor if signs of a second infection occur. Your medicine may need to be changed to treat this.
    <br>Hormonal birth control (eg, birth control pills) may not work as well while you are using Sumycin. To prevent pregnancy, use an extra form of birth control (eg, condoms).
    <br>Lab tests may be performed while you use Sumycin. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
    <br>Use of Sumycin in children may cause permanent discoloring of the teeth.
    <br>Sumycin should be used with extreme caution in children younger 8 years; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
