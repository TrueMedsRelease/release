<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> Ortho Tri-Cyclen is a combination birth control pill containing the female hormones ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. These hormones prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary). Ortho Tri-Cyclen is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy.
<br> Ortho Tri-Cyclen is also used to treat moderate acne vulgaris in females who are at least 15 years old. This medicine should be used for the treatment of acne only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> Take Ortho Tri-Cyclen exactly as prescribed by your doctor. You will take your first pill on the first day of your period or on the first Sunday after your period begins. You may need to use back-up birth control, such as condoms with spermicide, when you first start using Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Follow your doctor's instructions. Take one pill every day, no more than 24 hours apart. When the pills run out, start a new pack the following day. You may get pregnant if you do not take one pill daily.
