<strong>Common use</strong>
<br>
<br> K-Pet, containing the antifungal drug Ketoconazole, is used in dogs and cats to treat various serious fungal infections like ringworm, yeast infections (Malassezia dermatitis), and systemic fungal diseases (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, etc.), and sometimes for Cushing's disease.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosage and direction</strong>
<br>
<br> It is generally recommended to administer K-Pet with food, ideally a meal that contains some fat, as this can improve the absorption of the medication and minimize nausea. The veterinarian will provide the specific dosage instructions for your pet. If the dosage requires splitting tablets, this can be done on a flat surface to achieve accurate portions. It is best to avoid chewing or crushing tablets unless explicitly instructed by your vet. Administering the medication at the same times each day can help maintain consistent levels in the pet's system.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Precautions</strong>
<br>
<br> Not recommended for use in pregnant or nursing animals due to potential risks of birth defects and the drug passing into breast milk. Use with caution in cats as they are more susceptible to side effects, particularly liver toxicity.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Contraindications</strong>
<br>
<br> K-Pet should not be used in animals with a history of hypersensitivity to the ketoconazole or when taken with a long list of interacting medications that can cause life-threatening side effects, such as serious heart problems.
<br> Do not use in animals with existing liver failure or disease, and monitor liver function with regular blood tests during long-term treatment.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Possible side effect</strong>
<br>
<br> K-Pet tablets, which contain the active ingredient ketoconazole, can cause several side effects in pets (primarily dogs and cats). The most common side effects are gastrointestinal upset, while more serious issues like liver toxicity can also occur.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Drug interaction</strong>
<br>
<br> K-Pet (Ketoconazole) interacts with a wide variety of other medications, including antacids, H2 blockers (cimetidine), proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole), certain heart medications, and some cholesterol-lowering drugs. Always inform your veterinarian about all other medications, supplements, or herbal products your pet is taking.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Missed dose</strong>
<br>
<br> Give the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not give two doses at one time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Overdose</strong>
<br>
<br> Seek your veterinarian for emergency medical attention.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Storage</strong>
