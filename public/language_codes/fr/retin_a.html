            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
Avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays (sunlamps or tanning beds). Tretinoin topical can make your skin more
sensitive to sunlight and sunburn may result. Use a sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) and wear protective clothing if you must
be out in the sun. Avoid getting this medication in your eyes, mouth, and nose, or on your lips. If it does get into any
of these areas, wash with water. Do not use tretinoin topical on sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, irritated, or broken
skin. Also avoid using this medication in wounds or on areas of eczema. Wait until these conditions have healed before
using tretinoin topical. Use this medication for as many days as it has been prescribed for you even if you think it is
not working. It may take weeks or months of use before you notice improvement in your skin. If you are using tretinoin
topical to treat acne, your condition may get slightly worse for a short time when you first start using the medication.
Call your doctor if skin irritation becomes severe or if your acne does not improve within 8 to 12 weeks.
