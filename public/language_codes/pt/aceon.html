<p><strong>INDICATIONS </strong></p><p>Aceon is used for treating high blood pressure. Aceon is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking ACE, an enzyme involved in narrowing blood vessels and causing sodium and fluid retention by the kidneys. This causes blood vessels to relax, allowing blood to flow more freely and at a lower pressure, and increasing the heart's ability to pump blood in some types of heart failure.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Use Aceon as directed by your doctor.</p><ul><li>You may take Aceon with or without      food.</li><li>Take Aceon regularly to receive the most benefit      from it.
