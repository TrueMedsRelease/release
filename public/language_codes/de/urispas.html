            #BLOCK_OPEN_TAG#
You may get drowsy or dizzy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs mental alertness until you know
how this medicine affects you. Do not stand or sit up quickly, especially if you are an older patient. This reduces the
risk of dizzy or fainting spells. Alcohol can make you more drowsy. Avoid alcoholic drinks.#NEXT_LINE_TAG#

Your mouth may get dry. Chewing sugarless gum or sucking hard candy, and drinking plenty of water may help. Contact your
doctor if the problem does not go away or is severe.
